MEMBERS EVENT Carnegie Museum of Art Sunday, April 6, 9 a.m.–noon

Raymond Saunders: Flowers from a Black Garden is the artist’s first survey exhibition at a major American museum and the most in-depth consideration of his practice to date.

Since the 1960s, artist Raymond Saunders (b. 1934) has developed a painting practice rooted in improvisation. Working across mediums, he combines everyday objects, found imagery, drawing, notational markings, and text in constellated compositions that blend abstraction and figuration against the complex backdrop of American history.

Join us for a special look at the exhibition and an opportunity to socialize with fellow members over light bites and refreshments.

He is the God of war, Guardian of agriculture, Spring, fertility, virility, and bounteous nature. He is Mars. Mars—or as the Ancient Greeks originally called him, Ares—begins as the god of bloodshed, not widely admired (unsurprisingly) by his fellow Olympians or us Earthly mortals. However, once Rome comes about, Ares gets a rebrand to become Mars, the emblem of Rome’s military dominance and a symbol of its overall prosperity and success. Not all that dissimilar from how Mars the planet has transitioned from being the (imagined) home to hostile alien invaders to humankind’s (possible) new benefactor.
