OF THE ALLIES ON FRIDAY, JULY 19 – SUNDAY, JULY 21, 2024!Returning for its 9th year, the signature Heinz pickle balloon will once again fly above Downtown Pittsburgh the weekend of July 19th. Produced by the PDP and presented by Kraft-Heinz, Picklesburgh is a free, multi-day festival full of fermented fandom and fun. With dill-icious food from around the region and the world, pickle-themed merchandise, live music, free ‘Lil’ Gherkins’ activities, and a heart-pounding pickle juice drinking contest, there’s something for everyone to relish!Recognized as a ‘Signature Event’ by the Commonwealth by the Pennsylvania Tourism Office, Picklesburgh has grown every year since launching in 2015and continues to garner national (and international) attention. Last year, the location of the event moved from the Sister Bridges to a larger footprint on Boulevard of the Allies, seeing over 200K people attend and breaking all prior attendance records.

“The festival was originally created to bring people downtown during summer when weekends were quiet, and business was slower. Almost a decade later, I don’t think we could ever have envisioned how the region has embraced this event and made it something so uniquely Pittsburgh,” said Jeremy Waldrup, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. “We’ve grown significantly every year, and it looks like that will happen again in 2024!”
