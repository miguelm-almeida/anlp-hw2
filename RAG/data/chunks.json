It was something that I had to work through, and I think it was something that I needed to look at myself in the mirror and say I have to have a better game,a\u0302\u0080\u009d Jarry said. a\u0302\u0080\u009cJust going down, working hard and working on my game was a big help for me.

Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997.

Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football.

The move gives the Steelers the upgrade at wide receiver the team has been searching for since the 2024 offseason. Metcalf, who turned 27 in December, is one of the top big-play wide receivers in the NFL. At 6-foot-4, 235 pounds, he is a massive mismatch for most NFL cornerbacks. Metcalf also ran a 4.33-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2019 while also posting a 40 A\u03021\u20442-inch vertical leap. His 40 time set a Combine record for the fastest by a player weighing more than 225 pounds. His explosiveness has translated to the NFL, as Metcalf has had at least 900 receiving yards in all six of his NFL seasons, surpassing 1,000 yards three times. His best season came in 2020 a\u0302\u0080\u0093 with Russell Wilson at quarterback a\u0302\u0080\u0093 when he caught 83 passes for 1,303 yards and 10 touchdowns."}, "chunk_1083": {"id": "chunk_1083", "text": "In 2024, Metcalf had 66 receptions for 992 yards and five touchdowns in 15 games. In his career, he has 438 catches for 6,324 yards and 48 touchdowns, playing in 97 of a possible 100 games. He's averaged 14.4 yards per reception in his career, including 15.0 in 2024. Metcalf has been even better in the postseason, catching 26 passes for 451 yards and five touchdowns in four playoff games, an average of nearly 113 yards per game. Joining Metcalf with incumbent outside receiver George Pickens, the Steelers will boast one of the biggest and most explosive starting duos in the NFL. In 2024, Metcalf ran 85 percent of his routes split wide, averaging 13.7 yards per air target, with 26 percent of his targets being 20 or more yards downfield. Pickens ran 80 percent of his routes split wide in 2024, averaging 13.5 yards per target with 29 percent of his targets coming 20 or more yards downfield. Metcalf ran a vertical route on 53.6 percent of his routes in 2024, the highest rate in his career."}, "chunk_1084": {"id": "chunk_1084", "text": "He recorded 503 yards on those routes, third-most in the NFL.

Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old \u201csoda jerk\u201d at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream \u2013 typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry \u2013 and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit! The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler\u2019s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as \u201cDr. Dave\u2019s\u201d among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert. Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition."}, "chunk_2782": {"id": "chunk_2782", "text": "The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry. Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90. In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split, \u201cIce-Cream Joe\u201d Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler\u2019s invention with the \u201cFrom Pitt Came the Split\u201d Event. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel\u2019s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record. Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants."}, "chunk_2783": {"id": "chunk_2783", "text": "It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania!

He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013.
