Great city... great neighbors! Young professionals, empty nesters, families—thousands are making their new home in Greater Downtown Pittsburgh. Downtown living. What’s the attraction? For many, the incredible convenience of walking to work is a perfect reason to start. But that’s only the beginning. The views are spectacular; the green spaces, including riverfront trails, are plentiful; theater, nightlife, great restaurants, and exciting sporting events are all within easy walking distance. And the living spaces themselves – from modern apartments and condos to spacious lofts in historic buildings – are beautifully distinctive. When you make the choice to live in Downtown Pittsburgh, you’ll be living in the best Downtown in America. Parks + Riverfront Downtown may be the City’s urban center, but we also have some great parks and riverfront trails to explore! Point State Park opened in 1974 and is a 36-acre park located at the tip of the Golden Triangle that features expansive lawns, riverfront tails, and the famous Point State Park Fountain which sprays water up to 150 feet into the air at the head of the park, where the Allegheny River and Monongahela River meet to form the Ohio River. Be sure to visit Golden Triangle Bike Rental or Kayak Pittsburgh to make the most of Point State Park and be sure to check out Friend’s of the Riverfront for information on riverfront trails and activities throughout Pittsburgh. Mellon Square, first opened in 1955, is a garden plaza, the first of its kind to be built atop a parking garage, that covers just over 1.25 acres. In 2014, the park was rededicated after a complete revitalization project was undertaken by the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy in cooperation with the City of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation. Market Square, the home of many of PDP’s programs such as the Market Square Farmers Market, is officially a City of Pittsburgh park! Be sure to keep an eye on our website for all of the latest events planned for the Square.

“We moved to the city because we wanted to be in the epicenter of Pittsburgh. Living downtown has allowed us to be spoiled by the convenience factor and amount of activities in downtown. We walk every day, take buses when necessary to Pitt or CMU, and have a car for emergencies. We would tell anyone considering moving downtown to – ‘Just do it!’” – Joe & Rosemarie “We choose to move downtown because we love architecture and we were looking for a cool urban space in which to live. We found our building walking from the YMCA one day. We live at 429 First Avenue which is a former paper warehouse that was converted into lofts in 1998. We were immediately drawn to the open industrial feel, the exposed ceiling beams and concrete floor. Since moving here almost 4 years ago, we can’t envision living anywhere else. Our favorite thing about living downtown is that we are within easy walking distance to the Strip District, North Shore, South Side, and Station Square – in addition to all of our favorite downtown locations. Although we still have the benefits of a small roof top garden, we no longer spend our weekends on yard work and driving for basic amenities. We are better able to take advantage of the recreational and cultural offerings that make Pittsburgh a great place to live.” – Chris and April “My husband and I moved from Boston to Pittsburgh in 2000 to launch AlphaGraphics in the Cultural District. Wanting to be close to our business, we were drawn to The Pennsylvanian for downtown living and the opportunity to be a part of the growing vitality of the arts and restaurant scene that was about to explode in the area. At The Pennsylvanian, we have a very unique, historic space to call home—it features dramatic 18-foot ceilings, stunning crown moldings, and gleaming hardwood floors and mahogany paneling. What’s the best part? We’re just steps away from hearing a world-class symphony concert, watching a Broadway show, dining at any number of wonderful restaurants, cheering on a professional sports team, and biking breathtaking trails along the three rivers. Having lived in other major metropolitan areas in urban settings, we think Pittsburgh is a real jewel—and so do our friends who come to visit us. One of my greatest pleasures is working out with my trainer near the stadiums along the water, with the backdrop of our beautiful city. We love living downtown and couldn’t imagine being in the suburbs.” – Clare “Downtown Pittsburgh is right now in the midst of the most impressive renaissance I have ever witnessed. It is so exciting and I am so hopeful about this City’s future that I am in the process of trying to open a hardware store down here. I see nothing but good coming our way and am delighted to live right here in the heart of it all and be a part of the new retail, art, and community scene I see unfolding. I attribute much of Pittsburgh’s rebirth to the hard work of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership and the conscious decision of our mayor to make Downtown Pittsburgh a safe and clean place for people to live, work and play 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. I am truly proud to be a Downtowner and invite others to come down here and give it a try!” – Donna Share this page Contact Us412-566-4190Email Us Pittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222 Share this page Connect With Us... © 2025 Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership.

Held in June, Market Square becomes a showcase for businesses, artists, makers, performers, food purveyors, and more from across the various international and newcomer communities. Developed in 2013, the Downtown Activation + Public Art initiative is a multi-year effort to enhance the Downtown neighborhood through public art events, creating thoughtful and innovative programming that enlivens unique areas throughout Downtown Pittsburgh. Live music plays an important role in providing a higher quality of life within urban neighborhoods by supporting cultural expression, social identity, economic development, and most importantly a positive and safe sense of place.

Developed in 2013, the Downtown Activation and Public Art initiative is a multi-year effort to enhance the Downtown neighborhood through public art events, creating thoughtful and innovative programming that enlivens unique areas throughout Downtown Pittsburgh. Our efforts employ object-, programming-, and community-based strategies to create a more sustainable neighborhood. Over the past few years, the PDP has successfully implemented a number of programs to enhance the vibrancy of Downtown, from the transformation of Market Square and the expansion of our programming to the installation of public art in Strawberry Way. To build upon these efforts, the PDP will continue to initiate a range of programs and installations that enliven Downtown. Penn Avenue | Around Downtown | Cultural District | Garrison Place | Strawberry Way | Market Square | Walking Tours & Publications Pittsburgh Postcard, 2022by Phil Seth Designed and painted by Pittsburgh native Phil Seth, this mural was created as part of efforts to enhance 6th Street as a destination dining corridor in the heart of Downtown’s Cultural District. This work is made possible with the generous support of the Benter Foundation. Emerging Visions 2.0, “Send My Love to the Hill,” 2024by Charlese Dawson Charlese Dawson’s “Send My Love to the Hill” is a love letter to the neighborhood where she grew up, connecting the past and present of both The Hill and her own experiences to imagine the future. Complemented by poet Jhordan Price near the corner of Seventh Ave and William Penn Place, Dawson’s work invites pedestrians and drivers to pause in their commutes and journeys to contemplate the life and joys of residents of the Hill District today. She brings in the voices of poets writing about Black life and joy, friendship, and family to complement her photographs that represent a community that has undergone dramatic change, decay, and renewal. Rainbow Road, 2022by Max Gonzales & Shane Pilsterand students from Pittsburgh CAPA This new 440-foot long street mural has transformed Downtown’s Strawberry Way into a vibrant work of public art created by students of Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts. Planting Seeds: Taking Steps, 2023by Do What We Love, a Pittsburgh-based artist duo created by Max Emiliano Gonzales and Shane Pilster The vibrant murals adorning the Frank & Seder Building at 441 Smithfield Street beautifully encapsulate nature’s tranquility and the bustling cityscape, adding a burst of color to a prominent corner of Downtown. They are part of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership’s Great Route Project, a transformative initiative aimed at enhancing the pedestrian experience in Downtown Pittsburgh. The Forbes Avenue side of the building features “Planting Seeds,” a mural that celebrates the natural beauty of Pittsburgh. Its design harmonizes with the new planters installed along the Forbes Avenue corridor, turning this high traffic area into a softer streetscape with more natural textures. In contrast, “Taking Steps,” located on the bustling Fifth Avenue side, captures the essence of an active Downtown streetscape. Greedy Pigeons, 2022by Josie Norton Coffey Way Shadow Gallery, 2024by Clear Story The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (PDP) has unveiled a new site-specific artistic lighting installation on Coffey Way between Sixth Avenue and Strawberry Way. With support from the PDP’s Uncommon & Curated Fund and a grant provided by the Colcom Foundation, the Shadow Gallery was created by Pittsburgh-based lighting design and production firm Clear Story, and is now operational in the evening hours. “The installation creates an experiential conversation between the patterns of light projection across the surfaces of Coffey Way and the images contained within the lightboxes,” said Rob Long, Principal and Design Director of Clear Story, a Pittsburgh-based design and consulting firm. Cultural Trust Projects Explore 13 different public art projects installed throughout the Cultural District in Downtown, including large-scale sculptural pieces, temporary activations, and art you can interact with. Elemental, 2024Carolina Loyola-Garcia Coming August 2024 Elemental is a site-specific multi-channel video installation designed to showcase a loop of nature videos depicting the ocean, an active erupting volcano, snow, wind, sunsets, clouds, and flora. The alternating footage of nature provides passersby a moment to wonder and a window into worlds far from the downtown business atmosphere. It is meant to serve as a moment of respite or as an invitation to a few minutes of meditation or solace. Read artist statement. Emerging Visions, 2023Various artists This collaboration with Silver Eye Center for Photography features the works of rising Pittsburgh artists on the windows of currently vacant storefronts along Liberty Ave., creating a public art gallery in the heart of Downtown. Skinny Building Mural, 2023by Alexis Gideon, Loring Taoka, and Sophia Marie Pappas The Art Supply Co. worked with PNC Bank to reimagine the historical Skinny Building in Downtown Pittsburgh with support from the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. The result is the Art in the Heart program, a large-scale mural project which covers the second and third story windows of one of the world’s narrowest commercial buildings. With theater lights placed strategically inside, the piece becomes a lightbox at night and encourages viewing at all hours. Through an open call for regional artists, three artists were chosen to participate in a paid design process: Alexis Gideon, Loring Taoka, and Sophia Marie Pappas. Judah, 2022 by Curtis Reeves Downtown Renown, 2020by Gavin Benjamin The “Downtown Renown” installation features 14 artworks and stories that celebrate the careers of Pittsburgh sports icons and athletic groundbreakers. Installed in windows around Downtown, find artistic renderings of household names from Mario Lemieux and Franco Harris, to Swin Cash, Dan McCoy, and more, showcasing a breadth of talent and accomplishments that is truly inspirational. Garrison Canal, 2018by Andrea Polli If you were disappointed to see the beautiful lighted artwork, Energy Flow, disappear from the Rachel Carson Bridge, you will be happy to learn that lighted elements of the original artwork have been re-used to create a dynamic new piece: Garrison Canal. Andrea Polli, who created the original work, has created the new light work which turns the Garrison Place alleyway into an imaginary underwater future world of big data. Visitors to the Canal “swim” below a wave of thousands of shimmering lights that transform color and animate in response to real-time changes in the local weather conditions from a weather station Downtown. The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership commissioned this piece as a wonderful opportunity to reuse elements of work that was much-loved by Pittsburghers and visitors alike. The project is part of a larger initiative to enliven Downtown alleyways with lighting, artwork, and pedestrian enhancements. Garrison Canal can be viewed in Garrison Place, between the 900 block of Liberty Avenue and Exchange Way. “Garrison Canal continues the effort of many in Downtown to utilize art to encourage exploration of our beautiful built environment” said Jeremy Waldrup, President and CEO of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. “Enhancing unexpected places through art makes a neighborhood unique, enjoyable and accessible for everyone.” Paint The Town Purple, 2024by Babesburgh Babesburgh is proud to launch Paint the Town Purple, a new public art exhibition funded by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership’s Placemaking Grant. Paint the Town Purple offers passersby a chance to see a visual, historical representation of 16 important women in Pittsburgh as imagined and illustrated by four Pittsburgh-based female artists. These incredible, colorful illustrations will be on display along Smithfield Street, at Mellon Square Park. “I’m immensely grateful for the opportunity to uplift and depict so many influential Pittsburgh women who made such an impact,” said Emily Paige Armstrong, one of the artists involved in the project, along with Janel Young, Stella Begnal, and Ifeoma Igwe. Thanks to our friends at the Office of Public Art and Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council, you can download free self-guided walking tours and a variety of publications detailing even more public art on display in and around Downtown.

Partners. Volunteers. Leaders. Alumni. Friends. The members of the CMU Alumni Association Board are all of these and more. This hardworking group of alumni reflects the diversity of the university’s alumni body, spanning a broad range of colleges, class years, careers and hometowns as well as interests and experiences. But they all have one thing in common: a dedication and love for CMU. AAB members use their creativity and professional and volunteer experience to work closely with the Office of Alumni & Constituent Engagement to develop and strengthen programs that connect alumni to CMU and to each other. For more information about the AAB and how to get involved, contact Jess Tkach in Alumni & Constituent Engagement. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?The CMU community is incredibly passionate and caring. Every time I'm surrounded by my fellow alumni, I'm always struck by how accomplished and enthusiastic they are about the impact they're making on the world. I like to be around people who are making moves — they inspire me constantly. Why did you join the AAB? I can humbly say that CMU made me the person I am today and I'm incredibly grateful to the staff, faculty, and my fellow students. This is my way of not only giving back to a school I love so much, but also a way for me to stay connected. Favorite CMU memory:My most cherished memories are when I was together with my amazing community, whether it be studying together in the ChemE cluster, practicing a piece for Dancers' Symposium, putting together the roof of SigEp's booth, or sneaking around campus rooftops (oops!). What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Honestly, the stories from fellow alumni make everything worth it. Each CMU alumni has such an amazing story, whether it's a story of their upbringing, the story of how they got to CMU, their CMU experience, or the story of whatever amazing thing they're inevitably up to. Favorite CMU memory:Joining Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, being a founding member of COMPASS, SPIRIT fashion show weekends, spending time with my residents when I was a Resident Assistant and hanging out in the CMARC office. Why did you join the AAB? I joined the AAB because CMU has left such an invaluable mark on my life. I believe in the vision of CMU and feel it is important to support CMU so that this phenomenal experience can be available for future generations. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Getting to meet new people who share my enthusiasm for the school and for creating the best experience for current and future students. Why did you join the AAB?Carnegie Mellon has always held such a special place in my heart and it's given me so much — and now it is time to give back. Favorite CMU memory:My final year at CMU, the university hosted the Frontiers Conference, which featured world-class innovators working at the cutting edge of personal, local, national, global, and interplanetary frontiers. I was invited because of my humble work starting an organization at the local frontier in Pittsburgh, and it was incredible getting a chance to hear President Obama speak about how new frontiers in science and technology will help improve lives and shape the future. It remains to be the coolest conference I've ever attended! Why did you join the AAB?I joined because I have loved being an active alumnus and serving as an organizer of DC's Globally Plaid series, speaking on alumni panels, serving as a Heinz College mentor, and helping with mock interviewing. The student group I founded in 2015, Students Using Data Science for Social Good, (which still exists!) was aimed at bringing together students from all of the colleges that CMU has and uniting them around a common purpose; I look forward to bringing that same sense of community to this role. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?The number of sheer jaw-dropping talented and distinguished alumni that have excelled in their verticals Why did you join the AAB?To stay engaged and give back to the University gave me life long friendships, mentors, memories and got me my job, giving me the foundation to set me up for life. Favorite CMU memory:As I walked through campus on graduation day I felt like every step on the sidewalk revealed a flashback to a moment. I felt all my effort, time, friendships and achievements of four years as we walked to the stadium. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I enjoy sharing the lessons that have stuck with me from my time at CMU with students. It's equally empowering and energizing to connect with fellow alumni, sharing our accomplishments and exchanging on ways to elevate the University and each other. Favorite CMU memory:The night the Steelers won Super Bowl XL. As news editor of The Tartan, I watched the game from the office as we put the newspaper to bed. A few of us left to celebrate, then came back to finish The Tartan in the middle of the night. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I love Carnegie Mellon. I am grateful for the opportunity to be involved at this level, to interface with faculty and staff, and to represent the diverse voices of our alumni. Through the AAB, I feel I’m able to offer a positive impact on the alumni community. Favorite CMU memory:The friends I made at the schools are still close friends. Why did you join the AAB?I'm proud of how the schools is growing and evolving and I wish to help shape the next evolution Favorite CMU memory:I was a member of an amazing team that won the University's first-ever Presidents Athletics Conference Championship in women's basketball and advanced to the NCAA regionals in 1989. Why did you join the AAB?I am looking forward to sharing my experiences and expertise for the benefit of a university that has done so much for me. Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory is walking back from an evening Chem lab class across campus and hearing someone practicing the bag pipes - quintessential CMU and a personal favorite since I was also a music minor. Why did you join the AAB?Interacting with CMU Alumni always makes me feel energized and excited and has helped me in a lot of transitions in my life. I wanted to help give that feeling back to alumni and give back to the school by joining the AAB. Favorite CMU memory:My favorite memory at CMU was to be a part of two acts in Tepper follies my graduating year. I was part of an international fashion show and also did a ballroom dance group number. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I enjoy most going to campus events and learning about the latest cutting edge research by students and professors. A bonus is actually talking to the students on their research studies. Favorite CMU memory:I bleed Carnegie Plaid. If you really want my attention, include Scotty Dog. My first month of school, I had tailgate parties that included such dignitaries as university Deans and the famed mascot himself. This memory is one of my favorites and most mentioned by my good friends from CMU. Why did you join the AAB?My passion for CMU has not waned since leaving Pittsburgh. As an alumnus, I have been active with Carnegie Mellon University and Heinz College and participate in many alumni events and programs - both social and academic. This includes recruiting, student consulting initiatives, and attending alumni events near home. I recently moved from Chicago to Colorado. What do you like most about staying engaged?One of the benefits of being on a college campus is the diversity of thought. This diversity challenges your belief system and makes you question your purpose as well as contributions to society. I found inspiration in our student body as this engagement only makes me a better person. Why did you join the AAB?Volunteering has afforded me the opportunity to give back. If we are stronger together, working with individuals who share the same passion for making Carnegie Mellon the best it can be, can only yield a positive outcome. I want to be the representative who encourages other alumni to get engaged. Favorite CMU memory:PhD Graduation Ceremony. August Wilson, who was awarded a honorary PhD, gave a very inspiring and thought provoking speech. Why did you join the AAB?Create a stronger alumni network that becomes an advantage and differentiator. Raise the profile of CMU in the US and internationally. Favorite CMU memory:I remember how excited I was the day I pledged my fraternity. I have such fond memories of all the major events on campus including Spring Carnival, Home Coming and intramural sports. Why did you join the AAB?I am so incredibly grateful for Carnegie Mellon for the terrific education and wonderful on-campus experience afforded me. I am indebted to the university for being so supportive in helping me pursue my post-graduate education and my career. I love coming back to campus and interfacing with the students, faculty and staff. This Board provides yet another opportunity for me to have a positive impact at the University level and in the alumni community. Favorite CMU memory:During my 10 years as a CMU undergrad, PhD student, and instructor from the 1960’s through the mid 1970’s, I took advantage of the unique environment where everyone on campus could use CMU computers, initially with punch cards and later in computer rooms with teletypes. I was a participant in the formation of a new discipline. I also loved playing clarinet in the Kiltie Marching and Concert bands with the fabulous music majors. We had memorable trips performing at a National Music Educators convention in Buffalo and at Town Hall in New York City. Why did you join the AAB?Being from SCS and being retired, I hope to bring a unique perspective to the Alumni Board. I want to learn more about CMU’s academic and research initiatives in Pittsburgh and other CMU campuses, and how the Alumni Board interacts with the multi-campus alumni. Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory is when I outsmarted those who were against SPIRIT's "Black Week," joined the Student Senate Finance Committee, and made "Black Week" an official arm of the Student Senate so it could be funded directly from student activities funds and not bake sales and car washes. Why did you join the AAB?I joined because I was chosen to be a part of this elite group in which I take great pride. It is an honor and a privilege and a once in a lifetime event for me that means I get to give back in my own unique way! Favorite CMU Memory:My experience at CMU is a trove of memories: Crew Club, meeting and dating my husband, hard and fun work in the 3D wood shop, and the Beaux Arts Ball. My peers and the staff made each moment special. One poignant memory was sledding by the cafeteria on trays! What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Tartan pride is alive in my household. The connection we have from studying at, working at, and/or supporting Carnegie Mellon University is genuine and rewarding. It brings me joy to build personal relationships with the CMU community and receive a smile simply from saying, I am a Tartan, too! Favorite CMU Memory:It is really hard to pick just one! A big highlight was planning the concert for the 100th Carnival; being on Activities Board was an amazing community, and getting to plan and see the events was so energizing. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I loved my time at CMU. I got so much out of it, and one of the best parts was the people. Joining AAB allows me to be involved in the CMU community, and help alumni connect back to CMU and to each other. Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory was the INI holiday party and the spirited karaoke-ing to "Hey Jude" with friends and faculty. Between such moments of levity and all of the hard work, I forged some lifelong friendships at CMU. Why did you join the AAB?CMU has been a big part of my life and career and I am very proud to be a Tartan. I want to be able to contribute back to the school and help bring the alumni community together. Favorite CMU memory:Going to the "Apple Orchards", not knowing Apple would grow to its size today but thinking how innovative and convenient it was back then. That convenience made it easy to be efficient with projects and homework, which enabled me to indulge in Buggy ... a sincere passion, GO SPIRIT!!! Why did you join the AAB?Having been an active alum for many years, my professional experience will hopefully be extremely helpful to both alums and the university. Specifically, giving-back in any fashion has been a passion for decades and having raised two daughters who are both college graduates, along with corporate experience in recruiting and career development, I believe I can help improve the experience for all parties involved. Favorite CMU memory:Watching my two older sisters apply to, study at, and graduate from CMU was probably one of the most impactful and inspiring CMU memories of mine. They blazed the trail, set the standards and showed me what was possible at, and with, a degree and network from CMU. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?It is so exciting to be around such a motivated, intelligent and hard-working group of people, across disciplines. I love to hear about what different students and alumni are doing as well as learn from them. Each year, the AAB chooses new members who are eager to contribute to the university and the global CMU alumni community.

The CMU Alumni Association proudly honors these members of the CMU community, all of whom have made an impact on their industries, their communities, their alma mater and others' lives around the world. The annual Alumni Awards event brings alumni, students, faculty, staff and friends together to celebrate those receiving the Founders Medal for Outstanding Service and Exceptional Achievement, Alumni Achievement Awards, Alumni Service Awards and Recent Alumni Awards. The Founders Medal is presented to an alumnus/a in recognition of both a longstanding record of service to and support for Carnegie Mellon University, and a record of professional or vocational achievements that are truly exceptional and have brought honor and prestige to themselves and to CMU. All alumni are eligible for this award, including those who have received prior alumni honors from the university or one of its colleges, schools or departments. Awarded to an alumnus/a for exceptional accomplishment and leadership in the nominee's professional or vocational field, which brings distinction to themselves and honor to the university. The contribution(s) need not be publicly renowned but should represent important creative effort or accomplishment with significant impact and value. Presented to an alumnus/a for volunteer service to the university or any of its alumni organizations. Several dimensions of service are considered, including breadth of service (service in multiple CMU volunteer roles), depth or longevity of service, and impact of volunteer service on the alumni organization and/or the university. Financial contributions are specifically excluded from consideration for this award, although volunteer service soliciting contributions on behalf of the university or service on CMU fundraising committees is applicable. This award does not consider volunteer service to non-CMU organizations. Similarly, Carnegie Mellon employees or those alumni with business relationships to the university are not eligible on the basis of their employment duties or business services. CMU's greatest assets are its people — the alumni, students, faculty, staff and friends who have forged CMU's legacy of innovation and excellence. Since 1950, the CMU Alumni Awards have recognized alumni in the CMU community for their service to the university and their impact on the world, and for their accomplishments and leadership in their professional or vocational fields. Help us honor outstanding Tartans with these four, easy-to-complete steps: We encourage nominators to review the Alumni Awards categories to ensure you’re selecting the best fit for your nominee.

Like last year, all 30 Major League clubs will field teams of their best prospects at the showcase CLEARWATER, Fla. – This year’s Trade Deadline will arrive on July 31, but the Braves won’t have to wait until the dog days of summer to make some impactful acquisitions.

PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. -- The Rays announced Thursday that they will not be moving forward with their plans to build a new ballpark as part of a redeveloped Historic Gas Plant District in St. Petersburg. The Rays made the news official on their social media accounts with a statement from CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Long after Zack Wheeler and Jesús Luzardo pitched a simulated game on Monday at BayCare Ballpark, Bryce Harper grabbed his first baseman’s mitt. A morning downpour had postponed his scheduled infield work, but he did not want to skip it.

Paul Skenes striking out Jackson Holliday. Jackson Chourio reaching twice and scoring a run. Jace Jung hitting a pair of homers. FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The Red Sox feel better about their starting pitching depth than they’ve felt in years, and it’s going to be put to the test early in the season. Red Sox manager Alex Cora revealed to The Boston Globe before Thursday’s game in Port St. Lucie against Cubs outfielder Seiya Suzuki stepped into the batting cage recently to take some cuts. Literally. Ahead of next week’s Tokyo Series, the native of Japan stepped into the right-handed batter’s box wielding not a baseball bat but a SAMURAI SWORD -- and what came next was exactly what you’d expect PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- In a vacuum, Jeff McNeil’s injury is “a minor hiccup,” as the second baseman put it -- an unfortunate case of a right oblique strain with two weeks to go until Opening Day.

While Guerrero doesn’t seem distracted in the least, this remains a story that is going to hang over the Blue Jays TOKYO -- When Luis Cruz first saw Shohei Ohtani -- then a 19-year-old in his second professional season in Japan -- the former remembers thinking, "Oh my God, this guy's going to be good." That said, Cruz had no idea at the time that Ohtani -- whom he thought would It has never been done in Major League Baseball. It may well never be done in Major League Baseball.

Greg Brown is is in his 31st year as a radio and television play-by-play announcer with the Pirates. Greg’s association with the Pirates began in 1979, when he interned in the promotions department while attending Point Park University. Following the World Series that year, Brown worked as the clubhouse manager at Pirate City during the Instructional League program in Bradenton, Florida. His 10-year stint in the Bucs front office included work in the Marketing, Public Relations and Broadcasting departments. Greg also served as the team’s public address announcer during the 1987 campaign. In 1988, he was a sports anchor on WFMJ-TV in Youngstown, OH. Prior to joining Pittsburgh’s broadcast team in 1994, Brown spent five seasons (1989-1993) doing play-by-play and color commentary for the Buffalo Bisons of the American Association (now International League) as well as hosting a sportstalk show on WGR Radio. He also worked as a color analyst and a pre and postgame show host for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League for five seasons (1989-93). Brown’s dedication and passion for the Pirates extends to his efforts away from the broadcast booth as he makes numerous off-season appearances in the community, both in the Pittsburgh area and in Bradenton during spring training. Brown is a native of Washington, D.C. He currently resides in Renfrew, PA, with his wife, Kim, and their son. Joe Block is in his ninth season of calling Pirates play-by-play action, having joined the TV and radio broadcast teams in 2016.

After an emotional farewell game in Pittsburgh back in October, Marc-Andre Fleury played against the Penguins for the final time on Sunday in Minnesota. In that first matchup, the beloved, fan-favorite netminder - who was drafted by Pittsburgh first overall in 2003 and won three Stanley Cups during his 14 years with the franchise - made 29 saves in a 5-3 Wild victory. Today, however, his oldest friends secured final bragging rights - with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin both scoring in a 3-1 win. âI was waiting for Tanger (Kris Letang) to score!â Bryan Rust joked afterward. âBut yeah, itâs cool. Sid and I were actually joking about it before the game. I was like, wouldnât that be nice if you got the game-winner tonight? And here we are [laughs].â Meanwhile, Fleuryâs line of thinking had been, there's no way these guys will score on me! "Oh my God. Anyone but these two,â Fleury said afterward. âI feel like I'm going to hear about this for a long time. Sid is still talking about his goal in junior against me.â As he was making those remarks in the home dressing room, Crosby confirmed them from the visitors dressing room. âTo get one there in the last game against him, I will remind him of that many times,â the captain said with a grin. Crosby speaks to the media As always, Crosby and Malkin found a way to craft a great script. It felt so fitting that those two were the only players to find the back of the net against one of their all-time favorite teammates, considering how much they loved competing against each other in practices. âHe's probably saved a lot more than I've scored against him, but definitely a fun competition there,â Crosby said. âHaving to go against him every day in practice, enjoyed that. That definitely made me better, and having him as a teammate did, too.â Fleury called that his favorite part of their time together. âObviously, playing together, winning together, those are such good memories and a lot of fun and all the best,â Fleury said. âBut to be with these guys every day, and the group of guys that we had all these years is awesome, you know? So, to battle with them and have some laughs in practice and yell at them when I stop them... though tonight, I couldnât laugh at them.â Crosby admitted that his goal was lucky, as it went off Wild defenseman Brock Faber before crossing the goal line. Malkinâs came on the power play before Crosby iced the win with an empty-netter. After the game, they caught up with Fleury in the hallway outside of the locker room. âSometimes, you make good friends, you see guys every day for 14 years with these guys, and I don't see them much anymore, right?â Fleury said. âSo, it's hard. It's hard when that happens, right? But I still always keep such good memories, and when we see each other, it feels like no timeâs passed, right? It's like, back to our time there together.â Fleury speaks to the media While Crosby said the most important thing was to compete and have fun with this day, he did do some reflecting coming into the contest. For him, what came to mind is how fast time goes. âYou feel like yesterday, you're coming into the league,â Crosby said. âI was so happy to be joining a young group of guys, including Flower, that had high expectations. We were all kind of growing up together in the league. So, I think you reflect on that. Just all the great moments that he was a part of, and just all the little things, not even hockey sometimes. Whether it's the road trips or the off-ice, that stuff, thatâs the kind of stuff that sticks with you.â Another fitting part of today was Fleury moving into second place for all-time starts among goaltenders in NHL history (1,015), against the team he spent more than half of them with. âTo play as long as he has at such a high level, you have to truly love what you do, and he does,â Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said. âYou can see it every day with how he goes about his business, how he carries himself. He loves being on the ice. He loves competing with his teammates, and I think that's why he's beloved, because of his joy and love for the game, and the position that he plays. Thatâs why he's been able to endure. âI mean, he's a talented guy and all of that, and a fierce competitor, but there's a lot of talented guys. His passion for the game, I think, is what has allowed him to endure the career that he has for as long as he has.â The plan is for Fleury to play the rest of this season, and then officially hang them up. With the Wild in the playoff mix and looking to make a run, Fleury couldnât let himself get too caught up in the significance of this game. At least, not right now. âHonestly, I tried to not make it too emotional... I just tried to stay in the moment, play the game,â Fleury said. âI think it's something I will think about and look back in the years to come.â Founding Partners pittsburghpenguins.com is the official website of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Heâs posted a 2-0-0 record with a 1.49 goals-against average and a .955 save percentage, both of which rank first among all goaltenders since March 9. Penguins Captain Sidney Crosby had four-straight goals for the Penguins, scoring the last two goals at Minnesota on Sunday and the first two goals vs. Vegas on Tuesday. The forward leads the Penguins in assists (47) and points (70). With multiple goals tonight, Crosby will record just the second three-game multi-goal streak of his career. His only three-game multi-goal streak came from November 28-December 3, 2009 (7G). Crosby has recorded a multi-goal game against 31 different franchises, which is the most among all players in NHL history. The only teams he has yet to accomplish the feat against are Utah and Pittsburgh. With three more assists, Crosby will have the 12th 50-assist season of his career, tying Adam Oates for the eighth-most such seasons in NHL history. He is currently three points away from tying Wayne Gretzky for the fourth-most points with a single franchise in NHL history. Crosby has been on an exceptional run at PPG Paints Arena as the forward has had points in eight-straight home games dating back to Feb. 1.

After Tuesdayâs overtime win against Vegas, Tristan Jarry handed the player of the game helmet to Erik Karlsson, who had scored the winner. âI would give it to you back if I could,â the defenseman told his goaltender. As Mike Sullivan put it, Jarry was the difference in that game â just like he was on Sunday in Minnesota, his first NHL game action since Jan. 14 against Seattle. Prior to that, Jarry had been with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League after being placed on waivers, as he struggled to find consistency during the first three-plus months of the year. âIt was a tough time for me. It was something that I had to work through, and I think it was something that I needed to look at myself in the mirror and say I have to have a better game,â Jarry said. âJust going down, working hard and working on my game was a big help for me. Obviously, I had a lot of support, so I think that helped a lot. Coming back here, I wanted to put my best foot forward and show the Penguins that I could do it.â Jarry speaks to the media. They knew Jarry was capable, as heâs put together a solid body of work in this league thatâs included two NHL All-Star nods and some good runs â but also understood the challenge of trying to come out on the other side stronger. It couldâve been easy to fold under the weight of everything. Instead, Jarry handled it tremendously well. âItâs not an easy situation, whether itâs losing or being in the position he was in. As a goalie, there is so much pressure and so much expectations,â Sidney Crosby said. âI think being put in that situation, going to Wilkes, coming back, responding the way he has says a lot about him and his work ethic and his willingness to keep working and battle through it. Heâs done a great job of it, and weâre all definitely happy for him.â Going into that first matchup with the Wild, Jarry admitted to feeling some nerves along with excitement, saying he tried using it to his advantage. He ended up stopping 29 of 30 shots in a 3-1 win, and was particularly strong on a successful four-minute penalty kill. When asked about Jarryâs performance following the game, Bryan Rust broke into a huge grin. âI love that sh*t,â the star winger said. âHe was awesome tonight. He's been through a lot, obviously. He's come right back up here, great attitude, came in and had a hell of a game. I think that shows how high character he is.â Jarry followed that up with another strong outing once the team returned home following a three-game trip that included the trade deadline. Sullivan used the word âspectacularâ to describe Jarryâs play. âHe just looks big in the net,â Sullivan went on to say. âThe vantage point I get from the bench, you just don't see a whole lot, and thatâs usually a sign that he's playing a confident game. He's tracking pucks. He's playing with confidence. He's got a calm demeanor. His handles, as far as when he comes out and plays a puck, have been simple and efficient.â In addition to what Jarryâs brought on the ice, heâs been the exact same person off of it. Jarry came back to Pittsburgh with a great attitude, humble and candid about his game, but the same terrific teammate. Heâs quietly one of the funniest guys in the room with his quick wit and dry humor, someone everyone enjoys being around, and theyâre glad to have Jarry back. âComing in, he hasn't changed one bit, which is awesome to see,â Karlsson said. âIt's easy to get down on yourself, but I think that he's come in here, and he believes in himself, and he's the same person he was since last we saw him. The last few games for us here, obviously he's proven that he's capable of winning games for us.â Founding Partners pittsburghpenguins.com is the official website of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Over the last year, Penguins President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas and his staff have accrued assets, flexibility and cap space as they work to return the Penguins to contention as soon as possible. This week alone, which culminated with the NHL trade deadline on Friday, Pittsburgh collected a number of draft picks after the moves they made â which were: At this point, no team has more draft picks or selections in the first three rounds over the next three NHL Drafts than Pittsburgh. âTriples of the third (round) of (2025), triples of the second (round) in (2026) and triples again of the third (round) of (2027). Triples is best,â Dubas said with a smile. Now, the Penguins will start executing on the haul theyâve collected, guided by this main question: whatâs in the best interest of the team? For example, it wonât be feasible for the Penguins to use every single draft pick and expect all of those players to become part of the club sooner rather than later. Instead, theyâll make picks available for trade. âIf there are opportunities to use the excess capital that weâve accumulated, whether itâs cap space or draft picks or to add players to the program to help propel it ahead, we wonât hesitate to do that,â said Dubas, who understands that being sellers at the trade deadline is not what fans are used to in Pittsburgh, and said this canât be the norm every year. âI think Iâve always come in and said there is no ambition on my end to have this take any longer than it needs to take, both for the city and for the people who have put in a lot. Thatâs not just players, but staff that has been around for a long time. There is a certain level, and when the level drops off, you donât want the standards and the core ideology to erode. Thatâs what we worked towards each day.â The goal, said Dubas, is to try and build a group around the core players â starting with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang, with Erik Karlsson, Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell included in that mix â and give them one or two more chances to win while theyâre still on their current contracts, which have varying timelines. That being said, Dubas made a point to emphasize that they wonât necessarily turn around and spend all of their assets this summer, saying that some patience is still required, and that expectations must be tempered. âWe're going to survey the landscape as urgently as we can each day to find moves that can best help propel the team ahead,â Dubas said. âIf there aren't moves available, we will execute on these picks with our personnel staff â with (director of professional personnel) Andy Saucier and (vice president of player personnel) Wes Clark â to make sure we're bringing the best young talent that we can. âHow it lines up with the older players, all I can give is my pledge that we are going through everything we can to attempt to have them all have one last chance, or multiple, depending on how long they play. I'm not going to start to doubt with these guys.â In the meantime, Dubas said the message to Pittsburghâs roster moving forward through the rest of the season is that they expect the standards to be upheld, and they expect the players to come in, play hard and be at their best every single day. âThereâs a massive amount of opportunities for these guys who are on short-term deals or that have aspirations to remain in the league,â Dubas said. âFor the guys who have been up and down in the minors or here, for the new players coming in (like) Connor Dewar and Conor Timmins, Tommy Novak â itâs a great opportunity to assert themselves for where they want to be next season. Theyâre all under team control. We have huge expectations in Wilkes-Barre for what theyâre going to do the rest of the year, as well. âI know itâs not typical and we wonât allow it to become typical, but I do think this remaining five or six weeks is a great opportunity for the organization and the players within to show us that they are a part of bringing us back into contention.â Dubas also went into specifics on a few players, starting with the ones whose names came up the most in trade rumors. Hereâs what he had to say about those guys... RICKARD RAKELL: âHe is a big part of our program. â¦ Everyone has seen this year - heâs got a long history of the type of player that he is â but we see him every day, the type of person he his as well. When you have players that perform that way on a game-in, game-out basis that show the ability to respond when things donât go well then can propel themselves back into being near the top of the league and perform at that level, itâs not something that you â especially when you have them signed and they want to be a part of the community, they want to be part of the program, they know the path that weâre on and they want to be a part of helping to bring the team back to being in contention â I would say that you donât just push that out the door because that may be whatâs wanted. You have to do whatâs right for the Pittsburgh Penguins. And for us, having Rickard Rakell as part of the Pittsburgh Penguins was definitely the right thing to do as we measured it up against everything. Weâre happy to have him, heâs a big part of what we do and I know he really wants to be here.â MATT GRZELCYK: âThere was interest, teams kicking tires, but in the end, we got through the deadline and he remains a member of our team. We expect him to continue to have a strong season and when we brought him in, I pledged that we would give him the opportunity to get things back rolling. He's taken advantage of that. We'll continue to push him to do so here through the last stretch of the year." ERIK KARLSSON: âHe came in the same summer I did. The team is coming out of missing the playoffs. The attempt was to bring him in and the things we did in the summer of '23 to try to get a run, that was the strategy. Try to give it one jolt to try to propel it back in. It didn't work. So, Erik, to me, it's really from a team perspective, not having to do with Erik. The team is not in the contending space that it was in for the decades prior, frankly. So, with him, he's such a talented player. I know, night in and night out, like our team has, it can be a little up and down. But the skating continues to be some of the best in the league. Obviously, offensively and puck movement continues to be at that level. We have to keep pushing him. I think he can be a part of helping our team continue to move along. So, I don't sense with his skating or his talent and ability that there's going to be any real dropoff. There was no discussion, there was nothing taken to him about waiving his no-move. And he's not a player that we would look to just move along. He's a hugely valuable player in the league.

By Ali Trachta This year, maybe more than ever, we can all agree that voting is important. First and foremost, in this upcoming November election (stay tuned for our comprehensive Election Guide with details on candidates up and down the ballot). But second, just behind that, the most consequential vote you can make in this town, we think, is for Pittsburgh City Paper’s Best Of PGH Reader’ Poll winners. And boy oh boy, did yinz turn out. More than 25,000 of you, to be more precise, cast a staggering 321,269 votes up and down our ballot, creating a catalog of the abundant coolness permeating this city. Different people, places, and businesses, all nominated by you, duked it out for the top spot in categories like Best Nail Artist, Best Black-Owned Hair Salon, Best Happy Hour, Best Pierogies, and Best Bike Trail, as well as in curveballs like Best Bar to Drink Alone, Best Place to Celebrate Your Divorce, and Best Place to Have Sex in Public (do not tell them we sent you). But we still wanted to have more fun, so this year, City Paper’s editorial team threw in a bunch of extra Staff Picks to help you find some hidden Pittsburgh gems like Best Place to Get a Weird Flash Tattoo, Best Shitty Beer, Best Neighborhood to Pretend You're on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, and Best Unexpected Place to Spot Hotties. So dive in, enjoy, and a big, big thank you for exercising those voting muscles. Next, fellow Western Pa.-ers, we’ll use them to save democracy. -Ali Trachta Editor-in-Chief The best vegan and vegetarian eats in Pittsburgh for the plant-based and the plant-curious By Aakanksha Agarwal Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Pittsburgh’s top events: March 13-19 By CP Staff Tags © 2025 Pittsburgh City Paper

We the People of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh is known as many things: a union town, a tech darling, an “eds and meds” mecca, a haven for pierogi obsessives. But maybe Pittsburgh’s real treasure is, as they say, the friends we make along the way. It’s the people — our neighbors — who embody the true spirit of this place. The ones who want our hometown to be the best it can be, and who do the work to make that happen. This year’s class inducts movers and shakers from all corners of our community, such as Herman "Soy Sos" Pearl and Staycee Pearl, partners in life and work who are magnifying Black art from their studio in Braddock, and Nik Forsberg of Fet-Fisk, whose pop-up turned brick-and-mortar restaurant is receiving well-deserved national attention. We’re also honoring nurses who are carving a path for other healthcare workers, young activists risking their futures, and many others. We hope you read about this year’s award winners and feel proud that these are the sort of hardworking, problem-solving people Pittsburgh produces. Cheers to the honorees, who are rightfully the toast of the town. -Ali Trachta Editor-in-Chief People of the Year 2024 By Ali Trachta Pittsburgh's People of the Year 2024 — Visual Art: Emmai Alaquiva By Amanda Waltz Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Business: Khamil Bailey By Maia Williams Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Politics: Barb Warwick By Rachel Wilkinson Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Labor: West Penn Nurses By Colin Williams Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Music: Vicious Blade By Colin Williams Pittsburgh's People of the Year 2024 — Food and Drink: Nik Forsberg of Fet-Fisk By Rachel Wilkinson Pittsburgh's People of the Year 2024 — Activism: Students for Justice in Palestine By Rachel Wilkinson Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Literature: Michael Wurster By Jess Simms Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Health: Alecia Ott, Auto(nomous) Body Shop By India Krug Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Performing Arts: Herman "Soy Sos" Pearl and Staycee Pearl By Kahmeela Adams-Friedson Code & Crematory 2025 Wed., March 26, 7 p.m. @ LaRoche College Crafts & Crafts: Cat Toys @ Two Frays Brewery Love is in the air and on the calendar with these Valentine’s Day events By Rachel Wilkinson ‌This‌ ‌winter’s‌ ‌must-see‌ ‌arts‌ ‌and‌ ‌cultural‌ productions By CP Staff People of the Year 2024 By Ali Trachta Election 2024 By Colin Williams ‌The big, spooky Pittsburgh event guide: Oct. 3-Oct. 31 By CP Staff BEST OF PITTSBURGH 2024 Reader's Poll By Ali Trachta The furry helpers behind the scenes — City Paper's staff pets By CP Staff The big Pittsburgh summer events guide Make the most of your Pittsburgh summer with festivals, concerts, parties, and more By CP Staff Pittsburgh’s top events this spring: March 21-June 19 By CP Staff The best vegan and vegetarian eats in Pittsburgh for the plant-based and the plant-curious By Aakanksha Agarwal Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Pittsburgh’s top events: March 13-19 By CP Staff © 2025 Pittsburgh City Paper

By Ali Trachta This year, maybe more than ever, we can all agree that voting is important. First and foremost, in this upcoming November election (stay tuned for our comprehensive Election Guide with details on candidates up and down the ballot). But second, just behind that, the most consequential vote you can make in this town, we think, is for Pittsburgh City Paper’s Best Of PGH Reader’ Poll winners. And boy oh boy, did yinz turn out. More than 25,000 of you, to be more precise, cast a staggering 321,269 votes up and down our ballot, creating a catalog of the abundant coolness permeating this city. Different people, places, and businesses, all nominated by you, duked it out for the top spot in categories like Best Nail Artist, Best Black-Owned Hair Salon, Best Happy Hour, Best Pierogies, and Best Bike Trail, as well as in curveballs like Best Bar to Drink Alone, Best Place to Celebrate Your Divorce, and Best Place to Have Sex in Public (do not tell them we sent you). But we still wanted to have more fun, so this year, City Paper’s editorial team threw in a bunch of extra Staff Picks to help you find some hidden Pittsburgh gems like Best Place to Get a Weird Flash Tattoo, Best Shitty Beer, Best Neighborhood to Pretend You're on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, and Best Unexpected Place to Spot Hotties. So dive in, enjoy, and a big, big thank you for exercising those voting muscles. Next, fellow Western Pa.-ers, we’ll use them to save democracy. -Ali Trachta Editor-in-Chief Tags © 2025 Pittsburgh City Paper

Watt schreiben Steelers-Geschichte. Punkte, Punkte, Punkte: Die krassesten Steelers Games aller Zeiten! Was unseren Quarterback so besonders macht, erfÃ¤hrst du hier. Als Quarterback-JÃ¤ger hatte er in der Preseason 2024 richtig rasiert â bevor er von einer Verletzung ausgebremst wurde. Die Pro Bowl Games sind das All-Star-Wochenende im Football â und du kannst dafÃ1⁄4r sorgen, dass viele Steelers-Stars dabei sind. So schafft es die Steelers Nation immer wieder, AuswÃ¤rtsspiele zu Heimspielen zu machen Unter dem Quarterback blÃ1⁄4ht die Offensive der Steelers auf â das sind die GrÃ1⁄4nde dafÃ1⁄4r Mit seinem Sack gegen die Dallas Cowboys am 5.

Julius Welschofs Traum von der NFL lebt â bei den Pittsburgh Steelers kÃ¶nnte er jetzt ganz groÃ durchstarten. Die positiven VerÃ¤nderungen der Offensive durch Offensive Coordinator Arthur Smith sind deutlich spÃ1⁄4rbar â auch Defensive und Special Teams zeigen sich optimistisch. Die Pittsburgh Steelers haben eine Lizenz fÃ1⁄4r das Global Markets Program in Deutschland erhalten, wie die National Football League (NFL) heute bekannt gab Wie sich Santonio Holmes im Super Bowl XLIII verewigte â und Pittsburgh zum NFL-Rekordmeister machte. Steelers-Cheftrainer Mike Tomlin hat schon immer auf Geschwister in seinem Kader gesetzt. Hier erfÃ¤hrst du, warum Familie ihm so wichtig ist.

Watt ist das Gesicht der Franchise â und folgende Geschichten Ã1⁄4ber ihn solltest du kennen. Seit 2017 mischt JuJu Smith-Schuster im Dienste der Pittsburgh Steelers gegnerische Verteidigungen auf. Grund genug, ihn noch ein bisschen besser kennen (und lieben) zu lernen. Erfolg verpflichtet, Tradition noch viel mehr. Als eines der Ã¤ltesten Teams der NFL haben die Pittsburgh Steelers und ihre Fans Ã1⁄4ber die Jahre eine ganz besondere Kultur geprÃ¤gt. Big Ben und Troy Polamalu haben mit den Steelers zwei Super-Bowl-Titel gewonnen. Ernie Stautner ist der einzige in Deutschland geborene Hall of Famer.

The Pittsburgh Steelers will play their first ever regular season game at Croke Park in Dublin in 2025, as part of expanding their footprint into Ireland. The Steelers and Ireland have a deep-rooted connection. Read more >>> The Rooney family emigrated from the town of Newry in Northern Ireland to the United States in the 19th century, where the family ultimately settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Dan Rooney joined forces with Pittsburgh businessman Anthony J.F. O'Reilly to create The Ireland Fund in 1976, which merged with the American Irish Foundation to create the American Ireland Funds, a leading charitable organization benefiting Ireland. Dan Rooney's love of Ireland also fueled a passion to bring an NFL game to Ireland, a that dream became a reality when the Steelers took on the Chicago Bears in a preseason game in 1997 at Croke Park. Dan Rooney was asked to serve as United States Ambassador to Ireland by President Barack Obama, a role he cherished from 2009-2012. While in Ireland serving as Ambassador, Rooney visited all 32 counties on the island, meeting with politicians, media, business leaders and citizens. The Pittsburgh Steelers were awarded rights to expand their brand and activities for the Republic of Ireland & Northern Ireland, as part of the NFL's 'Global Markets Program', on May 23, 2023.

Michael McQuaid, Host of 'The Irish Steelers Podcast, Â reports the fan view on the island of Ireland after Friday's historic news. Historic game to be played in Dublin's iconic Croke Park Croke Park has hosted thousands of the country's most famous sporting events Starting in 2025, the NFL has the right to schedule up to 8 regular season international games per season. Up to 4 teams from the conference hosting a ninth regular season home game are now designated to play a neutral-site international game each year. In 2025, AFC teams will have a ninth home game on their schedule. Teams are selected based on the league's rotational system, which considers conference scheduling and teams that have Global Market Program rights in specific markets. The NFL has earmarked Dublin as a new international game market for 2025 and strategically selected the Steelers to play in the game as the designated team. As part of the Global Markets Program the Steelers have been awarded marketing rights on the island of Ireland because of Steelers' ownership family's deep roots there. Global growth is a major strategic priority for the league and 32 teams. Playing games outside the United States and expanding the league's global footprint is a key part of that strategy. The league's international games take American football to new fans and communities around the world. The Steelers will host 8 regular-season home games and 1 preseason home game at Acrisure Stadium in 2025. As this is a year in which AFC teams have a ninth regular season home game, the Dublin game will see the Steelers' designated to play the ninth game in Dublin in 2025. The Steelers and the NFL will host fan activities in Dublin leading up to the game. More information on these details will be released later this year. We encourage you to sign up for Steelers emails and to follow the Steelers social media platforms for information and updates on the events that the Steelers will host in Ireland.

The 'Global Markets Program', which launched in January 2022 as the International Home Marketing Areas (IHMA), grants NFL clubs access to international markets for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization activations as part of an important, long-term strategic effort to enable clubs to build their brands globally while driving NFL fan growth beyond the US. NFL clubs can apply for rights to selected international markets by submitting proposals for the International Committee to review each Spring. Clubs are awarded rights for at least a five-year term through the program. During this period, a club has the rights to pursue activities in that international market that are consistent with what they can do in their home market. There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997. Mrs. Patricia Rooney, whose family emigrated from County Mayo in the 1920s, was a guiding force in the establishment of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. When the NFL created the opportunity for all teams to become active in international markets, Ireland was on the team's short list. This license will enable the Steelers to bring back some of the traditions and initiatives instituted by Dan Rooney, as well as to bring some new ones forward. The NFL's 'Global Markets Program' allows the Steelers to be active across the island of Ireland. Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football. Flag is a part of the team's overall international strategy and is easy to play for young people of all ages. The Steelers also plan to enact other events, including watch parties and other football education experiences. The team is roughly two years into its NFL's 'Global Markets Program' in Mexico, and in that time, has held several in-market draft celebrations, a kicking clinic for both professional football players as well as young people, a pair of youth flag events, a large-scale watch party in Mexico City, as well as a business summit with members of the business community. We'll look to bring similar initiatives to Ireland; and plan to be thoughtful and intentional about how they are introduced.

Steelers Legends Community More than 1,700 players have worn the Black and Gold since the team was founded in 1933. Steelers players of the past paved the way for the Steelers of today and the future. The Legends Community was created by the NFL to celebrate, embrace, educate and connect all who have played in the League. A Legend is defined as a "person or thing that inspires." With less than 1 percent of high school football players eventually being drafted by an NFL team, Commissioner Roger Goodell defined an NFL Legend as anyone who "signed a contract and played at least one preseason game. Once a Player, Always a Legend." We celebrate our Steelers Legends. Many of them remain active in business and the community, and quite a few have made Pittsburgh their home. Once a Steeler, Always a Steeler. Visit this page to see what our Legends are doing now, as well as learn more about those who came before.

Los Pittsburgh Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Kansas City Chiefs el prÃ3ximo 25 de diciembre en lo que pinta para ser un partido durÃ­simo en la penÃoltima semana de temporada regular de la NFL. Los Steelers necesitan victorias en sus dos juegos restantes para asegurar el campeonato divisional pero la primera prueba no serÃ¡ nada fÃ¡cil. "Estamos honrados y emocionados de jugar en Navidad y ser parte de eso, pero tambiÃ©n estamos emocionados en estar en un juego asÃ­ de grande contra un gran equipo en nuestro estadio y regresar a nuestro trabajo y obviamente nuestro trabajo es ganar." comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin. No es casualidad que los Chiefs estÃ©n buscando su tercer anillo de manera consecutiva. Mike Tomlin hablÃ3 el domingo en conferencia de prensa ante los medios y resaltÃ3 la continuidad de Steve Spagnuolo como Coordinador Defensivo de Kansas City y los esquemas de presiÃ3n que utiliza el equipo en momentos decisivos de partidos. TambiÃ©n hablÃ3 sobre Chris Jones y lo multifacÃ©tico y clave que puede llegar a ser para el buen funcionamiento de la unidad defensiva de los Chiefs. Sobre la ofensiva de nuestro prÃ3ximo rival, sabemos de sobra lo que Patrick Mahomes puede hacer con el balÃ3n y la manera en la que sabe controlar y ganar los partidos, muchas de sus 14 victorias esta temporada han sido apretadas pero eso es lo que hacen los jugadores como Ã©l, marcan la diferencia y saben ganar partidos. Mahomes llegÃ3 con una lesiÃ3n de tobillo al partido del fin de semana pasado contra los Texans y aunque se le vio cojeando un poco en algunos momentos del partido eso no lo detuvo para salir por piernas varias veces y hasta anotar por tierra en una carrera de 15 yardas. Sobre los lesionados de Pittsburgh, hasta el momento de escribir esta nota no se sabe el status de oficial de Joey Porter (rodilla) y Ben Skowronek (cadera), quienes no pudieron terminar el partido pasado contra Baltimore. "Algunos de los jugadores que no tuvieron oportunidad de jugar ayer (vs Ravens) Justin Fields, DeShon Elliott, Donte Jackson, George Pickens y Larry Ogunjobi, todos tienen la oportunidad de jugar esta semana, dependiendo de lo que vayamos notando en la semana" comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin. Disfrutemos mucho de esta partido, que por primera vez serÃ¡ transmitido en Netflix en punto del mediodÃ­a, hora del centro de MÃ©xico.

Los Pittsburgh Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Cincinnati Bengals el prÃ3ximo sÃ¡bado por la noche en lo que serÃ¡ el Ãoltimo partido para el equipo de la temporada regular de la NFL. Los Steelers vienen de tres derrotas consecutivas y buscan sacudirse esa mala racha para llegar con otro momentum a su primer partido de playoffs. Los Ravens enfrentarÃ¡n a los Browns el mismo sÃ¡bado pero mÃ¡s temprano. Si Baltimore llega a ganar ese partido serÃ¡n campeones divisionales sin importar el resultado entre los Steelers y los Bengals, si los Ravens pierden y los Steelers le ganan a los Bengals, Pittsburgh se alzarÃ­a con la corona divisional del Norte de la Americana. Sobre el prÃ3ximo rival de los Steelers, los Cincinnati Bengals, no serÃ¡ un partido fÃ¡cil. Los Bengals todavÃ­a aspiran a un lugar en los playoffs y para eso deben salir victoriosos. La historia con Cincinnati esta temporada ha sido su defensiva, quienes no han tenido una buena campaÃ±a pero siguen peleando por un lugar en la postemporada gracias a la mÃ¡gnifica campaÃ±a que ha tenido Joe Burrow quien ha logrado por mÃ©ritos propios equilibrar esa balanza y con actuaciones muy buenas ha sacado partidos que parecÃ­an difÃ­ciles de ganar. En el primer partido de esta temporada contra los Bengals, Russell Wilson tuvo un desempeÃ±o extraordinario, lanzÃ3 para mÃ¡s de 400 yardas y tres pases de anotaciÃ3n. La ofensiva de los Steelers no ha tenido sus mejores partidos en el Ãoltimo mes y serÃ¡ importante entrar en ritmo temprano en el partido para poder remar con la corriente a favor. SerÃ¡ clave mantener el juego terrestre en alto nivel para prolongar las series ofensivas y mantener fuera del campo a Burrow, Chase, Higgins y compaÃ±Ã­a. "Hemos visto ciertas tendencias en partidos recientes y he hablado especÃ­ficamente de algunas cosas en este cuarto. Los intercambios de balÃ3n y nuestra habilidad de cuidarlo. Nuestra balanza se ha desequilibrado, lo hemos analizado y buscamos revertir eso", fue lo que comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin sobre uno de los cambios mÃ¡s importantes que debe hacer el equipo para asegurar la victoria. El partido lo podrÃ¡n disfrutar a travÃ©s de la seÃ±al de ESPN en MÃ©xico y obviamente en nuestro sitio con la voz de Ãlvaro MartÃ­n y Arturo Carlos, tambiÃ©n podrÃ¡n verlo por NFL Game Pass en DAZN en punto de las 7pm hora del Centro de MÃ©xico. Â¡Feliz aÃ±o nuevo a toda la Steeler Nation! Here we go!

Los Pittsburgh Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Baltimore Ravens en la primera ronda de los playoffs de la NFL. SerÃ¡ el tercer partido entre estos dos equipos tras sus dos enfrentamientos en duelos divisionales en los que dividieron victorias. "Jugamos contra alguien que es muy conocido por nosotros y nosotros muy conocidos por ellos, serÃ¡ la tercera ocasiÃ3n este aÃ±o y serÃ¡ en su estadio, por lo que tenemos que prepararnos mucho y estar listos para jugar", palabras de Coach Tomlin en conferencia de prensa. Para un partido como estos me gusta mucho empezar hablando de ambas defensivas. La defensiva de Pittsburgh se ha mantenido sÃ3lida pero los intercambios de balÃ3n no han llegado en los Ãoltimos partidos. En la temporada regular fueron 33 balones recuperados por nuestra unidad, siendo los lÃ­deres de la NFL junto a la defensiva de los Vikings en esta categorÃ­a. La defensiva de Ravens ha mejorado mucho desde la segunda mitad de la campaÃ±a y Mike Tomlin hizo referencia a que esa mejorÃ­a llegÃ3 gracias a su habilidad para evitar jugadas grandes en el juego aÃ©reo. Sin duda serÃ¡ un desafÃ­o para Russell Wilson y su cuerpo de receptores. Hablando de nuestro quarterback. Wilson es el segundo quarterback con mÃ¡s victorias en los playoffs de todos los presentes en la postemporada de 2024 con nueve triunfos, solamente Patrick Mahomes tiene mÃ¡s con quince. Â¿SerÃ¡ que la experiencia de Wilson ayude a la ofensiva a sacudirse las Ãoltimas presentaciones y cambie la cara en este duelo de eliminaciÃ3n directa? lo veremos el prÃ3ximo sÃ¡bado. Sobre la ofensiva que enfrentaremos sobran los adjetivos para calificar su desempeÃ±o esta temporada. Lamar Jackson sumÃ3 un aÃ±o histÃ3rico, probablemente el mejor de su temporada hasta ahora y si a eso le sumamos la doble amenaza en el juego terrestre con Derrick Henry la situaciÃ3n puede lucir complicada para la defensiva, aunque no serÃ­a la primera vez que nuestra unidad los detiene, es bien sabido que se necesitan cometer muy pocos errores y ser disciplinados en el campo a pesar de la rivalidad tan fuerte entre ambos equipos El partido lo podrÃ¡n disfrutar en MÃ©xico por Canal 5 de Televisa y por ESPN MÃ©xico el sÃ¡bado 11 de enero a las 7pm hora del centro y tambiÃ©n en nuestro sitio con la voz de Ãlvaro MartÃ­n y Arturo Carlos y NFL Game Pass por DAZN.

Steelers.com The Steelers signed running back Kenneth Gainwell to a one-year contract. Gainwell was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL Draft, the 150th overall pick, and spent the last four seasons with the Eagles. He has appeared in 66 games, including four starts, and carried the ball 280 times for 1,185 yards, a 4.2-yard average, and 12 touchdowns. Gainwell also has 102 receptions for 721 yards, a 7.1-yard average, and one touchdown. He also has 27 kickoff returns for 612 yards, a 22.7-yard average. "I love the toughness of this team, the toughness of this brand of football," said Gainwell. "And really, just Coach Mike Tomlin, I grew up watching the Steelers every Sunday, seeing the Steelers on TV and that just really drew my interest. "My brother (Kory) was a big-time fan of the Steelers. That just drew the line and got me watching the team. "And seeing what Coach Tomlin does with the running backs, for me to come in and implement my game and be the best version of myself." The Steelers faced Gainwell in a Week 15 matchup against the Eagles in 2024, when he rushed for 20 yards on seven carries, and had three receptions for 40 yards. He also had 63 kickoff return yards, for a total of 123 all-purpose yards in the game. "I bring a different game," said Gainwell of his style of play. "I can run any route out of the backfield, I can do anything out of the slot, protection, run game. Pass protection is big here and that is something I bring and can be high on." Gainwell played in all 17 games in 2024, starting one, while carrying the ball 75 times for 290 yards, a 3.9-yard average, and one touchdown. He also had 16 receptions for 116 yards, a 7.3-yard average as he helped the Eagles on special teams as well during their Super Bowl LIX season as he returned 18 kickoffs for a career-high 456 yards, a 25.3-yard average. In 2023, he played in 16 games, with two starts, and finished the season with 84 carries for a career-high 364 yards, a 4.3-yard average, and two touchdowns. He added 30 receptions for 183 yards, a 6.1-yard average. During the 2022 regular season he appeared in all 17 games, carrying the ball 53 times for 240 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 23 receptions for 169 yards, a 7.3-yard average. In the postseason, Gainwell led the Eagles with 33 carries for 181 yards, a 5.5-yard average, and a career-long 35-yard touchdown. He also had seven receptions for 55 yards, a 7.9-yard average, and his 236 yards from scrimmage also led the Eagles. In 2021, he tied for the most rushing touchdowns in franchise history for a rookie with five. He finished the season with 68 rushing attempts for 291 yards, a 4.3-yard average, and 33 receptions for 253 yards, a 7.7-yard average, and one touchdown for a total of six touchdowns for the season. Gainwell played college football at Memphis where he was a teammate of Steelers receiver Calvin Austin III. He played in 18 games at Memphis, starting 14, and had 2,212 yards from scrimmage, including 1,550 rushing yards and 662 receiving yards, with 17 touchdowns. He helped to lead Memphis to an AAC Championship in 2019 when he had an FBS-leading 2,069 all-purpose yards and 1,459 rushing yards, which ranked 12th nationally. He became the third player in Memphis history to register 2,000 plus all-purpose yards. He opted out of his final college season in 2020 after four relatives passed away due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Steelers.com The Steelers signed linebacker Malik Harrison to a two-year contract. Harrison was originally drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the third round of the 2020 NFL Draft, the 98th overall pick and has spent the last five seasons with the Ravens. Harrison has appeared in 76 career games, with 35 starts. He has 144 career tackles, 78 of them solo stops, and seven tackles for a loss. He also has two sacks, four quarterback hits, and one pass defensed. He also has 30 special teams tackles, including 17 solo stops. "It's my presence and how aggressive I am, and my versatility," said Harrison of how he fits with the Steelers defense. "I can play inside, outside. I can do it all, special teams, I'm all over the place. So that's what I think I can bring. "Special teams, I will do anything to make this team win. Special teams is a core to this game, and I feel like it's important. You've got one play, and you've got to make that one play count." Harrison plays with an edge, an aggressive approach that will have him fit right in with the defense. "I think that's just always been how I played throughout college and in high school," said Harrison. "I've always just been the guy that's very aggressive, I don't shy away from contact. I feed off of contact. If somebody gets me, I'm going to have to get you back." In 2024, he played in 15 games, with seven starts, and had a career-high 46 tackles, with 16 solo stops. He also had career-highs with two sacks, three tackles for a loss and eight special teams tackles. Harrison was part of a Ravens' defense that was ranked No. 1 against the run in 2024 (80.1 yards per game) and No. 2 in sacks (54) and fourth down efficiency (42.9%). Harrison appeared in 14 games in 2023, starting eight. He had 17 tackles, 11 of them solo stops, and three special teams tackles.

Los Pittsburgh Steelers perdieron 17-34 contra los Baltimore Ravens en el partido correspondiente a la semana 16 de la temporada regular de la NFL. El equipo perdiÃ3 la oportunidad de coronarse como campeÃ3n divisional, pero se mantienen como lÃ­deres del Norte de la Conferencia Americana y con un lugar en los playoffs asegurado. "No hicimos lo necesario para obtener la victoria. Felicito a los Ravens por su desempeÃ±o y su victoria. No controlamos el juego terrestre, nunca lo hicimos y cuando no puedes hacer eso tienes que ganar el juego con cambios de posesiÃ3n y jugadas de alto impacto, pero eso tampoco lo pudimos lograr" El no poder controlar el juego terrestre de los Ravens fue clave, Derrick Henry corriÃ3 para 162 yardas durante el partido y eso ayudÃ3 a Baltimore a controlar el partido y a desgastar a la defensiva de los Steelers. La primera mitad fue una muy de estilo de estos partidos divisionales, rÃ­spida, competida y muy pareja, los Ravens se fueron arriba 17-10. La defensiva y los equipos especiales ya habÃ­an dado seÃ±ales buenas provocando dos balones sueltos durante los dos primeros cuartos, pero en ninguna de las ocasiones lograron recuperar el ovoide. En los Ãoltimos cinco minutos del tercer cuarto Russell Wilson conectÃ3 con Cordarrelle Patterson, quiÃ©n en tres tiempos se llevÃ3 el pase de anotaciÃ3n con el que el juego se empatarÃ­a a 17. DespuÃ©s de eso los Ravens respondieron con siete puntos mÃ¡s. Con el marcador 24 - 17 a favor de los locales, Minkah Fitzpatrick interceptÃ3 un pase a Lamar Jackson que reavivÃ3 las esperanzas de los Steelers de empatar el partido en el Ãoltimo cuarto pero todo eso se derrumbÃ3 dos jugadas despuÃ©s del intercambio de balÃ3n cuando Russell Wilson fue presionado, lanzÃ3 un mal pase y Marlon Humphrey completÃ3 el pick six que separÃ3 todavÃ­a mÃ¡s el marcador 31-17. Una tarde complicada para la lÃ­nea ofensiva de Pittsburgh que permitiÃ3 3 capturas y varias jugadas forzadas por parte de Wilson debido a la presiÃ3n ejercida por la defensiva. Justin Tucker marcÃ3 la diferencia definitiva con un gol de campo que dejÃ3 el marcador 34-17 a favor de los Ravens. HabrÃ¡ que sacudirse esta derrota y dar la vuelta de inmediato porque el prÃ3ximo 25 de diciembre, en plena Navidad, los Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Chiefs en un juego que puede definir el orden de los playoffs en la Conferencia Americana. Hablaremos de ese partido mÃ¡s tarde en la semana. Con la mente en los Kansas City Chiefs. Here we go!

Los Pittsburgh Steelers cayeron en casa 29-10 ante los Kansas City Chiefs en el partido correspondiente a la semana 17 en Navidad. Los Chiefs fueron superiores dentro del terreno de juego y si a eso le sumamos castigos en situaciones clave y un par de intercambios de balÃ3n muy dolorosos se puede explicar la razÃ3n de haber salido sin la victoria. "No estamos haciendo las cosas bÃ¡sicas y fundamentales de buena manera, estamos perdiendo mucho el balÃ3n y no estamos forzando intercambios a nuestro favor. No estamos generando jugadas de alto impacto y no puedes ganar un juego contra un rival de ese calibre anotando 10 puntos" comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin ante los medios de comunicaciÃ3n tras el partido. Los Steelers fueron doblegados por el brazo de Mahomes, quiÃ©n lanzÃ3 para 320 yardas y tres pases de anotaciÃ3n. La lÃ­nea ofensiva de los Chiefs luciÃ3 muy fuerte y no permitieron capturas. Del otro lado la historia fue diferente, la lÃ­nea ofensiva de los Steelers sufriÃ3 para poder proteger a Russell Wilson, quien sufriÃ3 cinco capturas en el partido. El juego arrancÃ3 bravo, los Chiefs anotaron en sus primeras dos series ofensivas y fallaron un punto extra, la diferencia era de 13 puntos, la ofensiva moviÃ3 bien el balÃ3n pero cuando llegÃ3 a zona roja, Russell Wilson lanzÃ3 una intercepciÃ3n que impactÃ3 en el marcador. Ya en el segundo cuarto Wilson anotÃ3 el Ãonico touchdown del equipo con una carrera de una yarda. El juego terrestre ahora no fue factor Najee Harris y Jaylen Warren tuvieron mÃ¡s de 70 yardas por tierra y Russell Wilson 55 yardas pero eso no fue suficiente para marcar diferencia a la ofensiva, los 10 puntos de este miÃ©rcoles contra los Chiefs es la menor cantidad de puntos de la ofensiva desde la semana 13 del 2023 contra Arizona. Hay que darle vuelta a la hoja y pensar en el cierre de campaÃ±a en contra de los Bengals y en llegar con un mejor ritmo y con los errores corregidos de camino a los playoffs en el mes de enero.

Se terminÃ3 la temporada regular para los Pittsburgh Steelers, quienes cayeron 19-17 ante los Cincinnati Bengals este sÃ¡bado por la noche en Acrisure Stadium. EstÃ¡ fue la cuarta derrota consecutiva para el equipo, que termina la temporada como segundo lugar de la DivisiÃ3n Norte de la Conferencia Americana con rÃ©cord 10-7. Los Steelers no han tenido un buen desempeÃ±o a la ofensiva el Ãoltimo mes, de hecho en este partido la ofensiva no habÃ­a llegado a las 100 yardas entrado ya el Ãoltimo cuarto del partido. El juego terrestre no funcionÃ3 y de no ser por el extraordinario partido de Pat Freiermuth ( 8 recepciones, 85 yardas, 1 touchdown), el juego aÃ©reo tampoco tuvo un desempeÃ±o bueno. George Pickens regresÃ3 de su lesiÃ3n pero no se viÃ3 como Ã©l mismo y tuvo solamente una recepciÃ3n sin yardas ganadas y tres drops en ocho targets. "Particularmente del lado ofensivo del balÃ3n no hicimos las jugadas necesarias, no tuvimos fluidez, no convertimos las jugadas importantes, no anotamos", palabras de Mike Tomlin en conferencia de prensa tras el partido. El primer touchdown de los Steelers fue apenas en la segunda serie ofensiva del partido con un acarreo de una yarda de Najee Harris, la segunda anotaciÃ3n de los Steelers fue en el Ãoltimo cuarto con un pase de 19 yardas de Russell Wilson a Freiermuth. Del otro lado la defensiva nos mantuvo con vida durante todo el partido. En el primer cuarto le interceptaron a Joe Burrow un pase en el que buscaba a Chase pero Patrick Queen logrÃ3 desviar el balÃ3n y Beanie Bishop se lo llevÃ3. La situaciÃ3n en el final de la primera mitad en la que la ofensiva no logrÃ3 convertir una cuarta oportunidad y una yarda por avanzar le dio la oportunidad a los Bengals de sumar tres puntos claves en el marcador final y sobre esa decisiÃ3n Mike Tomlin comentÃ3: "No querÃ­a entregarles el balÃ3n con tiempos fuera en el reloj y decidimos ser agresivos en esa situaciÃ3n, si no logras avanzar una yarda en esa situaciÃ3n no mereces ganar y eso fue lo que sucediÃ3 hoy." En la segunda mitad la defensiva se vio muy fuerte, lograron contener a Burrow y la secundaria logrÃ3 ajustar bien, el partido se emparejÃ3. Los equipos especiales recuperaron un balÃ3n suelto en una patada de despeje que resultÃ3 en tres puntos mÃ¡s para Pittsburgh. La defensiva logrÃ3 detener a Burrow una vez mÃ¡s y con la ofensiva de dos minutos el equipo entregÃ3 el balÃ3n por oportunidades tras no poder convertir una cuarta y doce. Shoutout a Cameron Heyward, quien tuvo un gran partido defendiendo tres pases. TambiÃ©n cuatro de nuestros defensivos registraron una captura cada uno (Queen, Herbig, Benton y Smith). Con los resultados del fin de semana los Steelers se encuentran como el sexto sembrado de la AFC, enfrentarÃ¡n a los Ravens en Baltimore el sÃ¡bado 11 de Enero a las 7 p.m. hora del centro de MÃ©xico. En la semana tendremos mucho mÃ¡s informaciÃ3n de lo que viene para los playoffs. Here we go!

La Liga Nacional de FÃotbol Americano jugarÃ¡ su primer partido de temporada regular en DublÃ­n, Irlanda, en 2025, anunciÃ3 la liga el viernes. Los Pittsburgh Steelers jugarÃ¡n como el equipo local en el partido histÃ3rico. El partido de la NFL DublÃ­n 2025 se llevarÃ¡ a cabo en Croke Park, el estadio deportivo mÃ¡s grande de Irlanda y sede de la AsociaciÃ3n AtlÃ©tica GaÃ©lica (GAA), en asociaciÃ3n con el Gobierno de Irlanda y el Ayuntamiento de DublÃ­n. El presidente de los Steelers, Art Rooney II, y su familia tienen una rica historia y una profunda conexiÃ3n con la isla de Irlanda, ya que tienen familiares de Newry, County Down. El difunto presidente de los Steelers, Daniel M. Rooney, padre de Art Rooney, se desempeÃ±Ã3 como embajador de los EE. UU. en Irlanda de 2009 a 2012 y fue cofundador de la organizaciÃ3n benÃ©fica "Ireland Funds." Los Steelers tambiÃ©n son uno de los dos Ãonicos equipos de la NFL que han jugado un partido en Irlanda hasta la fecha, un enfrentamiento de pretemporada en 1997 contra los Chicago Bears en Croke Park como parte de la serie American Bowl. "Estamos encantados de traer oficialmente un partido de temporada regular de la NFL a Irlanda como parte de nuestra programaciÃ3n de juegos Internacionales de 2025", dijo el vicepresidente ejecutivo internacional, eventos, y negocios de clubes de la NFL, Peter O'Reilly. "Tanto la NFL como la franquicia de los Steelers tienen raÃ­ces profundas e historia en Irlanda, y estamos ansiosos por hacer nuestro debut en la temporada regular en DublÃ­n, llevando nuestro juego a una gran y apasionada base de aficionados irlandeses y subrayando el compromiso de la NFL con el crecimiento global". "Estamos muy emocionados de ser el equipo designado en el primer partido de temporada regular que se jugarÃ¡ en Irlanda esta prÃ3xima temporada", dijo el presidente de los Steelers, Art Rooney II. "La oportunidad para los Pittsburgh Steelers de jugar en Irlanda es realmente especial, no solo por la historia de la familia Rooney allÃ­, sino tambiÃ©n por jugar frente al creciente nÃomero de aficionados de los Steelers en Irlanda. Estamos encantados de ser parte de este evento histÃ3rico para representar a Pittsburgh en un juego que acerca la NFL a los grandes aficionados de los deportes en Irlanda". Sobre un juego en MÃ©xico en el futuro, Art Rooney II aÃ±adiÃ3, "Hemos hablado sobre nuestro deseo de jugar un partido en MÃ©xico muchas veces en los Ãoltimos aÃ±os y eso no ha cambiado. Nos encantarÃ­a jugar un partido frente a nuestros fanÃ¡ticos en MÃ©xico pronto y trabajaremos con la NFL para hacer lo que podamos para ayudar a que eso se haga realidad". Croke Park ha sido anfitriÃ3n de muchos momentos deportivos icÃ3nicos. Es la sede de la GAA, las finales irlandesas de fÃotbol gaÃ©lico y hurling, en 2003 se llevaron a cabo las ceremonias de apertura y clausura de las Olimpiadas Especiales y en 1996 se llevÃ3 a cabo el partido de fÃotbol universitario entre Notre Dame y la Marina. AdemÃ¡s de su herencia deportiva, el lugar ha recibido a Ã­conos musicales globales como U2, Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay y Taylor Swift.

Los Pittsburgh Steelers cayeron 28 -14 contra los Baltimore Ravens en el partido de la ronda de comodines de los playoffs de la NFL y con eso concluye su participaciÃ3n en la temporada 2024. Los Steelers tuvieron una primera mitad para el olvido en la que se fueron 21-0 abajo en el marcador, con una ofensiva inoperante y una defensiva incapaz de frenar el juego terrestre de los Ravens. "El factor X fue el talento Ãonico de Lamar (Jackson), cada prueba que tenÃ­a frente a Ã©l la superÃ3 y tampoco encontramos fluidez en nuestra ofensiva, destacando nuestra inhabilidad de convertir en terceras oportunidades durante la primera mitad y eso provocÃ3 que el equipo se desgastara." palabras de Mike Tomlin en conferencia de prensa. Sobre el juego terrestre de los Ravens nuestro head coach comentÃ3 "Cuando juegas 11 contra 11 con un qb asÃ­ de mÃ3vil y no haces una tacleada cuando debes, las cosas pueden salir mal, ese ha sido su modo de jugar y si sumas eso a todo el tiempo que la defensiva pasÃ3 dentro del campo el resultado es ese." Los Ravens tuvieron 299 yardas por tierra, 186 de esas yardas de Derrick Henry. Los Steelers solamente tuvieron 29 yardas por tierra en todo el partido. En la segunda mitad del partido los Steeler tuvieron una clara mejorÃ­a en ambas caras del balÃ3n, la ofensiva pudo anotar en dos ocasiones una con Van Jefferson y otra con George Pickens, quien tuvo un gran partido con cinco recepciones y 87 yardas. "La manera en la que liderÃ3 al equipo para salir en la segunda mitad fue increÃ­ble pero su actuaciÃ3n como la de todo el equipo no fue suficientemente buena para ganar.", fue lo que comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin sobre Rusell Wilson y su liderazgo nato. Rusell Wilson hablÃ3 ante los medios y seÃ±alÃ3 lo siguiente, "No nos rendimos nunca, la mentalidad en la segunda mitad fue otra y por eso estoy muy orgulloso de todos los chicos en el locker, nunca dejaron de pelear." Los Pittsburgh Steelers terminan su participaciÃ3n en la temporada y ahora no queda mÃ¡s que seguir trabajando para mejorar la prÃ3xima temporada y ver todo lo que nos depara la pretemporada entre las piezas de ajedrez que se moverÃ¡n. AquÃ­ tendremos siempre toda la informaciÃ3n. Gracias por una temporada mÃ¡s por su preferencia y por seguir apoyando a los Pittsburgh Steelers. Here we go!

Steelers.com The Steelers acquired receiver DK Metcalf in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks. The Steelers will send the Seahawks their second round pick (52nd overall) and seventh round pick (223rd overall) in the 2025 NFL Draft, and receive the Seahawks sixth-round pick (185th overall) in the 2025 NFL Draft. Metcalf also signed a new five-year contract with the team. Metcalf was drafted by the Seahawks in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft and spent the last six seasons in Seattle. In those six seasons, he has appeared in 97 games, starting 93 of them, and has 438 receptions for 6,324 yards, a 14.4-yard average, and 48 touchdowns, which rank eighth-most among active players in the NFL. He has three touchdowns longer than 70 yards, including a career long 84-yard touchdown. Metcalf has 15 100-yard games, including one against the Steelers in 2023, and a career-high 177 yards receiving against the Philadelphia Eagles in 2020. He also has two 100-yard receiving games in the postseason. He also has three 1,000-yard seasons and has 13 catches of 50 yards or more in his career, which ranks seventh among active receivers.. Metcalf was a second-team Associated Press All-Pro selection in 2020 and a two-time Pro Bowl selection in 2020 and 2023. In 2024, Metcalf appeared in 15 games, starting 12 of them. He had 66 receptions for 992 yards, a 15-yard average, and five touchdowns. Metcalf became one of only two players in NFL history, along with Hall of Famer Randy Moss, with 50 receptions, 900 yards and five touchdowns in each of their first six seasons. He also became the first player in Seahawks history with three consecutive 100-yard games, doing so in Weeks 2-4. He ranks first in Seahawks' history with receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns in his first six seasons and is fourth on the franchise's all-time receiving list. Metcalf had his third 1,000-yard season in 2023 when he started 16 games, pulling in 66 receptions for 1,114 yards and eight touchdowns, including a 73-yard touchdown, which was Seattle's longest play from scrimmage for the season. His 1,114 yards made him the seventh player in Seahawks history with back-to-back 1,000 yard receiving seasons. He set a single-season career-high in 2022 when he had 90 receptions, which were fourth-most in Seahawks history. He also turned in his second 1,000-yard season, pulling in 90 receptions for 1,048 yards and six touchdowns. Metcalf led the Seahawks with 75 receptions in 2021, while adding a team-high 12 touchdowns, which ranked fourth in the NFL and were tied for third-most in a single-season for the Seahawks. He had a career-long 84-yard touchdown against New Orleans, the third-longest reception in team history. In 2020, Metcalf posted his first 1,000-yard season when he had 83 receptions for a career-high 1,303 yards and 10 touchdowns, while being named second-team AP All-Pro and being selected to the Pro Bowl. The 1,303 receiving yards were a team record, passing Steve Largent who held the previous record of 1,287 yards. It didn't take Metcalf long to make an impact, with 58 receptions for 900 yards and seven touchdowns in 2019. His 58 receptions were second among all NFL rookie receivers, while his 900 receiving yards were third. Both the receptions and yardage numbers were second all-time in Seahawks' single-season history by a rookie. Metcalf played college football at Ole Miss, where he started 19 of 21 games played before leaving after his redshirt sophomore year. He had 67 receptions for 1,228 yards and 14 touchdowns.

Contributing Writer/Editor The Steelers signed cornerback Darius Slay to a one-year deal following his release by the Philadelphia Eagles. Slay, who turned 34 Jan. 1, has been a key member of Philadelphia's secondary since 2020 after a successful run with the Detroit Lions.p A six-time Pro Bowl player, Slay has 28 interceptions and 160 pass breakups in his 12-year NFL career. Though he did not record an interception in 2024, he had 13 pass breakups. Slay, a second-round draft pick of Detroit in 2013, is a willing tackler who will mix it up with opposing offensive players. He also excels at man coverage. In his career, he's allowed just 59.5 percent of passes thrown in his direction to be completed. Last season, opponents completed 60.4 percent of the passes they attempted in Slay's coverage, showing his coverage abilities have not slipped. Over the course of his career, Slay has been one of the few cornerbacks in the league who travels with the opponent's No. 1 receiving option. With the Steelers, he'll offer a solid option on the opposite side of third-year cornerback Joey Porter Jr. and give Porter a veteran former No. 1 cornerback from which to continue to learn the tricks of the trade. And with Slay on board, Porter won't be forced to follow the opposing team's No. 1 receiving threat unless the Steelers choose to do so. Slay has missed eight games over the past two seasons after previously being a very durable player over the course of his career. Despite missing those starts, Slay has played over 800 defensive snaps in every season since 2014. When he's healthy, he seldom comes off the football field. But with third-year cornerback Corey Trice also on the roster, the acquisition of Slay gives the Steelers three very viable outside cornerback options. Trice, like Porter, also can learn plenty from Slay, perhaps benefitting the Steelers for years to come.

Contributing Writer/Editor The Steelers have acquired two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks via trade. The move gives the Steelers the upgrade at wide receiver the team has been searching for since the 2024 offseason. Metcalf, who turned 27 in December, is one of the top big-play wide receivers in the NFL. At 6-foot-4, 235 pounds, he is a massive mismatch for most NFL cornerbacks. Metcalf also ran a 4.33-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2019 while also posting a 40 Â1⁄2-inch vertical leap. His 40 time set a Combine record for the fastest by a player weighing more than 225 pounds. His explosiveness has translated to the NFL, as Metcalf has had at least 900 receiving yards in all six of his NFL seasons, surpassing 1,000 yards three times. His best season came in 2020 â with Russell Wilson at quarterback â when he caught 83 passes for 1,303 yards and 10 touchdowns. In 2024, Metcalf had 66 receptions for 992 yards and five touchdowns in 15 games. In his career, he has 438 catches for 6,324 yards and 48 touchdowns, playing in 97 of a possible 100 games. He's averaged 14.4 yards per reception in his career, including 15.0 in 2024. Metcalf has been even better in the postseason, catching 26 passes for 451 yards and five touchdowns in four playoff games, an average of nearly 113 yards per game. Joining Metcalf with incumbent outside receiver George Pickens, the Steelers will boast one of the biggest and most explosive starting duos in the NFL. In 2024, Metcalf ran 85 percent of his routes split wide, averaging 13.7 yards per air target, with 26 percent of his targets being 20 or more yards downfield. Pickens ran 80 percent of his routes split wide in 2024, averaging 13.5 yards per target with 29 percent of his targets coming 20 or more yards downfield. Metcalf ran a vertical route on 53.6 percent of his routes in 2024, the highest rate in his career. He recorded 503 yards on those routes, third-most in the NFL. On Go routes in particular, he gained 374 yards, second-most in the league behind only Minnesota's Justin Jefferson (387).

Metcalf didn't disappoint in his rookie season even after sliding in the draft. It's raised the expectations for what many are expecting to be a breakout season for Seattle's second-year wide receiver. (AP Photo/Scott Eklund, File) Since Metcalf entered the NFL, not wide receiver has gained more yards on Go routes than Metcalf's 1,765 yards. A second-round pick in 2019 â two picks before the Steelers selected Dontae Johnson â Metcalf ranks fifth in receiving touchdowns, 12th in receiving yards and 16th in receptions in that span. In a 2019 NFL Draft that also included Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, Johnson, Marquise Brown and A.J. Brown, Metcalf ranks third in receptions and yards and second in touchdowns.

Contributing Writer/Editor The Steelers signed former Baltimore linebacker Malik Harrison to a two-year deal in free agency. Harrison, 27, enters his sixth NFL season as a special teams ace with starter capability. The 6-foot-3, 255-pound Ohio State product appeared in 76 career games with the Ravens, 34 of them starts. In 2024, the Ravens inserted Trenton Simpson into the starting lineup to replace Patrick Queen after he was signed in free agency by the Steelers. But the defense turned around in the second half of the season when the Ravens turned to Harrison to start the final seven games. Harrison played a career-best 382 defensive snaps, helping to settle things down on the second level for the Ravens. He finished the season with 54 tackles, two sacks and three tackles for a loss.

(AP Photo/Terrance Williams) Cleveland Browns place kicker Cade York (3) has his field goal attempt blocked by Baltimore Ravens linebacker Malik Harrison (40) in the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Harrison has the length to fill a role as a reserve edge rusher and the athleticism to play off the ball in space. A former third-round pick, Harrison ran a 4.66-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2020, also posting a 36-inch vertical jump. He's never played fewer than 288 snaps on special teams in his five NFL seasons and has topped 300 snaps on special teams in each of the past three seasons. With special teams ace Tyler Matakevich an unrestricted free agent and Elandon Roberts having signed with the Raiders, Harrison would figure to slide into that role with the capability of stepping into the lineup, if necessary, as a downhill thumper. He finished second on the Ravens with eight special teams tackles in 2024. With the NFL toying with the idea of tweaking its kickoff rules even more â including pushing the kickoff spot back five yards â to create more kick returns in 2025, having big, fast players who can run could become critical on those units. Harrison would fit the bill in that respect. Covering kickoffs was the one area where the Steelers struggled on special teams in 2024 as they -- and the rest of the NFL -- adjusted to the new kickoff rules.

Women of Steel is the Pittsburgh Steelers' platform celebrating the NFL's largest female fanbase. Through exclusive events, contests and content, our mission is to unite women from all walks of life who share a passion for the Black and Gold. Whether you're a die-hard Steelers fan or just started rooting for us, Women of Steel offers a community where you can connect, engage, and learn alongside other women of Steelers Nation. OUR PILLARS PNC SMALL BUSINESS SPOTLIGHT In Pittsburgh, small businesses are the backbone of our region, representing the determination we have to offer. In partnership with PNC, the Women of Steel Small Business Spotlight program will receive support from executives at PNC and the Pittsburgh Steelers, providing mentorship to women-owned small businesses while utilizing the Steelers platform to bring awareness to them.â Both organizations believe in a world where women transform companies and push society forward. This program is finding ways to support females, drive them to the top, and keep them climbing.â Stories Like Me Helen Campbell / Co-Owner and CEO Helen Campbell (she/her) and Imogen Campbell Hendricks (she/her) - co-owners, business partners, and mom and daughter team - are thrilled to be selected as Women of Steel. Stories Like Me is an indie bookstore for children through young adults, a community hub, and a safe space where all people can find themselves represented in books. To build their business, Helen and Imogen drew on their love of stories, along with their skills as project management professionals and musicians (musicians are very detail-oriented!). Before opening their brick-and-mortar store in Greenfield in November 2022, they did small pop-ups all throughout Pittsburgh to bring diverse stories into the community. Helen, a native of England began her career in film and TV, after which she worked as a project manager, brings all her Jedi/Mary Poppins-type super powers to making sure all kids and families can see themselves in stories. Imogen, named after a character from Shakespeare, reads everything voraciously, writes, organizes, and loves trying out boutique gins! They find their joy and passion through finding stories for all of our kids and families. Fierce Knockouts Karin Christoff / Owner Karin, a proud mother of two teenage boys and married to a fellow veteran, brings a unique journey to her business. Originally from Peru, she arrived in the U.S. with no English skills but, through much sacrifice, learned by attending night school. She served as a U.S. Army soldier and was deployed to Afghanistan.

Fairclaugh, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning emerged from a deeply personal journey. What began as a heartfelt tradition of creating custom gifts for Jarmele's beloved grandmother, who resided in a nursing facility, has grown into a thriving business dedicated to celebrating life's special moments. Jarmele's mission started with simple acts of loveâgift-wrapping chocolates, clothing, and shoes to bring a smile to her grandmother's face. Her grandmother, a cherished beacon of joy and strength in the family following the passing of Jarmele's mother, inspired the creation of Mele's Gifts & Party Planning. Following her grandmother's passing, Jarmele's familyâher son Michael and husband Markâencouraged her to turn her passion into a business. They established a website and business cards, and with their support, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning was born. Today, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning is proud to be part of a vibrant community of woman-owned businesses and is honored to be recognized as a Woman of Steel by the Pittsburgh Steelers and PNC Bank. We specialize in custom-created gifts and exceptional event planning, dedicated to turning your ideas into reality and making every occasion memorable.

Pittsburgh is a great city to visit, but especially for senior travelers exploring without children. It’s a very drivable city if you have a car. Or, you can easily order an Uber or Lyft if you arrived by Amtrak. Best of all, parking is plentiful around your favorite spots. If you love art and museums, this is your town. The Andy Warhol Museum on the North Shore reflects the Pittsburgh-born artist’s life with an eccentric artistic touch. Make sure you catch a glimpse of one of his most famous pieces, Campbell’s Soup Cans. You also can view many of his personal items, including a collection of wigs. Head across town to The Frick Pittsburgh in Point Breeze to enjoy a legacy of art, history and nature. The Car and Carriage Museum, included in The Frick’s free admission, is a ride through history. Plan accordingly so you can take your time and enjoy a leisurely stroll through the mansion, the museum and garden areas. Up for more walking? Make sure you include a visit to the Strip District where you’ll find a variety of shopping, including lots of black and gold merchandise, eclectic food and restaurant offerings and gift shops. Be on the lookout for The Strip Mural by artists Carley Parris and Shannon Pultz – it’s easily viewed on Penn Ave. For those wishing to savor all the flavors of the Strip District – or a handful of other Pittsburgh neighborhoods – consider booking a walking food tour with ‘Burgh Bits & Bites. Sports fans are in luck in Pittsburgh! The city is home to several professional teams, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins, and the locals are fanatical for their favorite sports teams. You can find a large area devoted to the teams at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located inside the Senator John Heinz History Museum. The Heinz History Museum pays tribute to more than the local sports teams. Here, you can learn so much about one of Pittsburgh’s most famous citizens, Mister Rogers, a national treasure. Find his monogrammed house slippers and one of his beloved red cardigans. The museum also is full of American history following the democracy of the country. When your legs need a respite from walking, rest assured there are several more relaxing ways to see the city. Book a tour on Molly’s Trolleys Pittsburgh. Not only will you visit several neighborhoods and see many of the city’s popular sites, but thanks to the fantastic tour guides, you also will learn a bit of regional history. One such nugget learned on a recent trip - ketchup wasn’t the first Heinz product produced; bottled horseradish was! Ride the Duquesne Incline up to the Mount Washington neighborhood for a spectacular view of the city. A quick ride back down will drop you off in the South Side neighborhood. Pittsburgh is widely known for its three rivers. Tour the city by water aboard the Gateway Clipper Fleet. Sit back and relax on the Three Rivers Sightseeing Cruise, which allows visitors a close view of the Downtown skyline and several of the city’s 446 bridges. And, the sunset cruises are a great option for a romantic night out. Speaking of those bridges, many of them are easily walkable, connecting Downtown to several of Pittsburgh’s 90 unique neighborhoods. In fact, the Sixth Street Bridge, commonly known as the Clemente Bridge, directly takes you from Downtown to PNC Park, home of the Pirates. Consider extending your Pittsburgh visit with a daytrip to the Laurel Highlands, where you can visit two of Frank Lloyd Wright’s most iconic homes, Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob. Visiting these residences is like stepping back in time, as the décor reflects the decade each house was built. When available, make sure you book a guided tour, as they provide an insider’s look at Mr. Wright’s thought processes, as well as the homeowners’. Visitors have their pick of comfortable lodging options in Pittsburgh, including several that are housed in historical buildings, like the Drury Plaza Hotel Pittsburgh Downtown which is a beautiful renovation of the Federal Reserve Bank building. Many pieces remain from the original bank including vault doors estimated to weigh 34 tons each. The property is located Downtown and within easy walking distance of many attractions, restaurants and Union Station. The Omni William Penn Hotel also makes for a lovely stay. The iconic hotel is home to Lawrence Welk’s original bubble machine. Plus, it’s also where Bob Hope proposed to his wife, Delores. Pittsburgh is a walkable city that offers visitors a chance to see spectacular sights, gain incredible knowledge at spectacular museums and attractions and indulge in tasty treats at their own pace. Make sure a visit to the City of Bridges is on your travel list soon! Contributing Author Rosemary Palmer is the owner and author of My Home and Travels blog.

Pittsburgh Area Farmers' Markets and U-Pick Farms Pittsburgh food has always been rooted in tradition and fresh off the farm. As a result, farmers' markets are a well established part of Pittsburgh culture. There are more farmers' markets and community gardens per capita in Pittsburgh than in most U.S. metropolitan areas. In season, you can find one just about every day of the week in different neighborhoods. Whether it's a church parking lot, a sidewalk stand, or a tent off the side of the road, these markets sell local farm fresh produce, eggs, cheese, homemade baked goods, jams and honey. Some farmers' markets even sell Amish-made wood furniture and rugs. For a complete list of Pittsburgh area farmers' markets, click here. If you want to get a little closer to your food, try harvesting your own produce at Pittsburgh area U-Pick Farms. You'll get some exercise as well as a great big bunch of fresh produce you picked yourself. Visiting a u-pick farm is a great family experience that is both fun and educational. There's something about harvesting your own food that makes you appreciate it more. Many U-Pick farms also have on-site stores selling other ready-to-go products from their farm. Many Pittsburgh area residents enter in to a more formal agreement with local farmers to ensure their seasonal supply of farm fresh products; including farm fresh beef and other meats. This is a relatively new and growing trend called, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). These agreements, and the products offered, vary by farm and help local families enjoy a variety of farm fresh products while providing local farmers a profitable outlet for their harvest. 72 0 Saved

Pittsburgh,  city, seat (1788) of Allegheny county, southwestern Pennsylvania, U.S. The city is located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which unite at the point of the “Golden Triangle” (the business district) to form the Ohio River. A city of hills, parks, and valleys, it is the centre of an urban industrial complex that includes the surrounding cities of Aliquippa (northwest), New Kensington (northeast), McKeesport (southeast), and Washington (southwest) and the borough of Wilkinsburg (east). Inc. borough, 1794; city, 1816. Area city, 58 square miles (150 square km). Pop. (2010) 305,704; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,356,285; (2020) 302,971; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,370,930.

Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.

Pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.

After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881.

By 1900 the city’s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power.

By the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre.

Much of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The University of Pittsburgh was chartered in 1787. Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966).

Central to the city’s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performs at Heinz Hall, a restored movie theatre.

Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensive greenhouses. The city’s zoo, in the northeastern Highland Park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. Two new sports venues opened in 2001 on the north bank of the Allegheny opposite the Golden Triangle: PNC Park is home of the Pirates, the city’s professional baseball team, and Acrisure Stadium houses the Steelers, its professional football team. The Penguins, Pittsburgh’s professional ice hockey team, plays at PPG Paints Arena. Popular summertime attractions include riverboat excursions on Pittsburgh’s waterways and Kennywood, an amusement park southeast of the city in West Mifflin.



=== Pittsburgh - Wikipedia ===

Pittsburgh (/ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia.

Pittsburgh is known as "the Steel City" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]

Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.

Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]

Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]
"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever."[20]

From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as "Pittsburg", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]

Kingdom of France 1690s–1763  Great Britain 1681–1781  United States 1776–present

The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]: 289

The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better source needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]

In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named "Pittsborough".[28]

During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]

During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "Manor of Pittsburgh".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.

On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]

Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.

The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[37] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[38]

The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.

In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany.

Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39]

The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.

In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.

The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[42]

The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.

The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[43] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[44] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[45]

During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[28] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"[46][47] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off."[48]

Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11]

In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.

During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[49]

In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[50]

Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.

The city is located on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[51] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as "the Point." The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.

Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to "hills," "heights," or similar features.[a]

The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[52] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[53]

Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.

The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[54] and four main areas surrounding it—Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. These areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods.[55]

Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine over 500 feet (150 m), with the U.S. Steel Tower being the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).[56] The Cultural District spans 14 blocks along the Allegheny River and is home to theaters, arts venues, and a growing residential community. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[57] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.

The North Side, originally the independent Allegheny City until being annexed in 1907, is a primarily residential area with well-preserved 19th-century homes. It hosts attractions like Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, the Andy Warhol Museum, and the National Aviary, among others.[58]

The South Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.[59] In the 1990s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into the SouthSide Works mixed-use development.

The East End includes key institutions including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, and Phipps Conservatory. It features many parks, including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods like Shadyside. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland is home to several universities and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs.[61]

The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia."[64] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "Paris of Appalachia",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.

Under the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.[73]

The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]

Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).

The American Lung Association's 2024 "State of the Air" report, covering data from 2020 to 2022, indicated that while Pittsburgh's air quality is poor, it is improving. The city ranked 26th for short-term particle pollution, earning an F grade, and 19th for year-round particle pollution. It received a D grade for ozone pollution, ranking 50th for ozone smog.[81][82] However, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.[83][84]

Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.[85] It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.[85] Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[86]

As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.[87]

Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure.[88] Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.[89] Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.[90][91] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[92] The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.[93][94][95]

The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.[96][97][98] While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.[99][100][101] In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[102] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[102]

There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.[103] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[103][104]

Since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the Lower Hill District underwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[13] This project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.[124]

In the 1960s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) aimed to revitalize East Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.[125] By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.[125]

These changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.[124][126] The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.[127]

Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[132] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[133] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[134] or the American Dream.[135] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[136] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[137] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as "the poster child for managing industrial transition".[138] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[139]

Pitt women began play in 1914 before being reintroduced in 1970. Both Duquesne and Robert Morris also have competitive Division I women's basketball programs.

The Riverhounds, an American professional soccer team, were founded in 1998. Like the major league teams in the city, the Riverhounds wear black and gold kits. The club plays in the Eastern Conference of the USL Championship, the second tier of the American soccer pyramid. The Riverhounds play their home games at Highmark Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located in Station Square.[citation needed]

Golf has deep roots in the area. The oldest U.S. course in continuous use, Foxburg Country Club dating from 1887 calls the region home.[216] Suburban Oakmont Country Club holds the record for most times as host for the U.S. Open at nine; it has also hosted the U.S. Women's Open, PGA Championships, and U.S. Amateurs.[217]

Golf legends Arnold Palmer, Jim Furyk, and Rocco Mediate learned the game and began their careers on Pittsburgh area courses.[218] Suburban courses such as Laurel Valley Golf Club and the Fox Chapel Golf Club have hosted PGA Championships (1937, 1965), the Ryder Cup (1975), LPGA Championships (1957–58), Senior Players Championships (2012–14), and the Senior PGA Championship (2005).

Local courses have sponsored annual major tournaments for 40 years:

Many notable professional wrestlers and promoters have hailed from the city or started their careers in Pittsburgh, including Bruno Sammartino, Kurt Angle, Shane Douglas, Corey Graves, Dominic DeNucci, Elias, Britt Baker and many more.

The Fineview section of Pittsburgh served as the base of the televised show Studio Wrestling during the 1960s.[219][220] The Keystone State Wrestling Alliance (KSWA) is a professional wrestling promotion which was founded in Pittsburgh in 2000. It is the only promotion based in Pittsburgh. It operates in the city's Lawrenceville neighborhood. The KSWA performs Monthly on Saturdays at its main venue on 51st Street.

Pittsburgh hosts several annual major sporting events initiated in the late 20th century, including the:

The city's vibrant rivers have attracted annual world-title fishing competitions of the Forrest Wood Cup in 2009 and the Bassmaster Classic in 2005.

Annual events continue during the winter months at area ski resorts such as Boyce Park, Seven Springs, Hidden Valley Resort, Laurel Mountain, and Wisp. Ice skating rinks are enjoyed at PPG Place and North Park.

The Government of Pittsburgh is composed of the Mayor of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh City Council, and various boards and commissions. The mayor and the nine-member council each serve four-year terms. Since the 1950s the Mayor's Chief of Staff has assumed a large role in advising, long term planning, and as a "gatekeeper" to the mayor. City council members are chosen by plurality elections in each of nine districts. The government's official offices are in the Pittsburgh City-County Building.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court holds sessions in Pittsburgh, as well as Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts and nine House Districts. Federally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district.

In 2006, Council President Luke Ravenstahl was sworn in as mayor at age 26, becoming the youngest mayor in the history of any major American city. His successor, Bill Peduto, was sworn in on January 6, 2014. In November 2021, Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor, Ed Gainey.

Prior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party,[221] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.[222]

Pittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts (Lindsey Williams (D)-38, Wayne D. Fontana (D)-42, and Jay Costa (D)-43) and nine House Districts (Aerion Abney-19, Emily Kinkead-20, Lindsay Powell-21, Dan Frankel-23, La'Tasha Mayes-24, Dan Deasy-27, Abigail Salisbury-34, Jessica Benham-36, and John Inglis-38).

Federally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Summer Lee since 2023.

The area's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, with close to 850 sworn officers. The city also has separate housing and school police departments. Other agencies also provide police protection within the city because of overlapping jurisdictional boundaries. The Allegheny County Sheriff focuses on jail and courthouse security. The Allegheny County Police primarily patrols county-owned parks and airports, while providing detective/investigatory functions for smaller suburbs and the Port Authority police patrols rapid transit. Pennsylvania State Police Troop B provides patrols for the city and immediate suburbs.

The county's lead law enforcement officer is Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala while the Allegheny County Medical Examiner heads forensics. Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's safest big cities, in 2013 being named the 3rd "most secure" big city by Farmers Insurance.[223] Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[224][225]
Per 100,000 persons stats (2012):

At the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[226]

In Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.[227] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.[227] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.[228] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.[228] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[229] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[230]

Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories "police budget cost per person," "fines / forefeitures," "Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population)," "Force Used per Arrest," "Racial Disparities in Deadly Force," "Excessive Force Complaints Upheld," "Discrimination Complaints Upheld," "Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld," "Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses," and "Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests." This is 10 out of 15 categories.[231]

Pittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University. Also in the city are Carlow University, Chatham University, Point Park University, the Community College of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the Pittsburgh Institute of Mortuary Science.

The campuses of Carlow, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Pittsburgh are near each other in the Oakland neighborhood that is the city's traditional cultural center. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private research university founded by Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon.[232] CMU contains the Mellon College of Science, School of Computer Science, College of Engineering, School of Business, Heinz College, College of Fine Arts, writing, Social and Decision Sciences, information systems, statistics, and psychology programs.

The University of Pittsburgh, established in 1787 and popularly referred to as "Pitt", is a state-related school with one of the nation's largest research programs.[14] Pitt is known for the Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences, Swanson School of Engineering, University of Pittsburgh College of Business Administration, University of Pittsburgh School of Law, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work, and other biomedical and health-related sciences.[232][233][234][235][236]

Carlow University is a small private Catholic university that while coeducational, has traditionally educated women. Chatham University, a liberal arts college that was founded as a woman's college but became fully coeducational in 2015,[237] is in the Shadyside neighborhood, but also maintains a 388-acre (157 ha) Eden Hall Farm campus in the North Hills. Duquesne University, a private Catholic university in the Bluff neighborhood and is noted for its song and dance troupe, the Duquesne University Tamburitzans, as well as programs in law, business, and pharmacy. Point Park University was founded in 1961 and is well known for its Conservatory of Performing Arts and its Pittsburgh Playhouse.

Pittsburgh Public Schools teachers are paid well relative to their peers, ranking 17th in 2000 among the 100 largest cities by population for the highest minimum salary. In 2018, the starting teacher salary offered to teachers with a BA was $46,920. The maximum annual salary for a teacher with a master's degree was $95,254.[238]

The city also has an extensive library system, both public and university. Most notable are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh's University Library System, which rank as the ninth-largest public and 18th-largest academic libraries in the nation, respectively.[239][240]

There are two major daily newspapers in Pittsburgh: the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review online only (no longer in print for Pittsburgh Area). Weekly papers in the region include the Pittsburgh Business Times, Pittsburgh City Paper, Pittsburgh Catholic, Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle, The New People, and the New Pittsburgh Courier. Independent student-written university-based newspapers include The Pitt News of the University of Pittsburgh, The Tartan of Carnegie Mellon University, The Duquesne Duke of Duquesne University, and The Globe of Point Park University. The University of Pittsburgh School of Law is also home to JURIST, the world's only university-based legal news service.[241]

The Pittsburgh metro area is served by multiple local television and radio stations. The Pittsburgh designated market area (DMA) is the 22nd-largest in the U.S. with 1,163,150 homes (1.045% of the total U.S.).[242] The major network television stations include KDKA-TV 2 (CBS), WTAE 4 (ABC), WPXI 11 (NBC), WINP-TV 16 (Ion), WPKD-TV 19 (Independent), WPNT 22 (The CW/MyNetworkTV), WPCB 40 (Cornerstone), and WPGH-TV 53 (Fox).

WQED 13 is the local PBS member station in Pittsburgh. It was established on April 1, 1954, and was the first community-sponsored television station and the fifth public station in the United States. The station has produced much original content for PBS, including Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, several National Geographic specials, and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?[243]

A wide variety of radio stations serve the Pittsburgh market. The first was KDKA 1020 AM, also the world's first commercially licensed radio station, which began airing on November 2, 1920.[244] Other stations include KQV 1410 AM (news), WBGG 970 AM (sports), KDKA-FM 93.7 FM (sports), WKST-FM 96.1 FM (Top 40), WAMO-AM 660 AM and 107.3 FM (urban contemporary) WBZZ 100.7 FM (adult contemporary), WDVE 102.5 FM (album rock), WPGB 104.7 FM (Country), and WXDX 105.9 FM (modern rock).

Three non-commercial stations are run by Carnegie Mellon University (WRCT 88.3 FM), the University of Pittsburgh (WPTS 92.1 FM), and Point Park University (WPPJ 670 AM).

Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[245] According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including The Mothman Prophecies, Wonder Boys,[246] Dogma,[246] Hoffa, The Silence of the Lambs,[246] Sudden Death, Flashdance,[246] Southpaw, Striking Distance, Mrs. Soffel, Jack Reacher, Inspector Gadget, The Next Three Days, The Perks of Being a Wallflower,[246] Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and Fences.[246][247] Pittsburgh became "Gotham City" in 2011 during filming of The Dark Knight Rises.[147] George A. Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his Living Dead series.[248] From 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh welcomed a series of major film and television productions like Fences, Mindhunter, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Sweet Girl, and I'm Your Woman, significantly contributing to the local economy.[249][250]

Film production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007.[251][252] The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.[253] Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them.[252]

Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include the Three Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.[254][255] The local film schools include Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Point Park University - Cinema & Digital Arts, and University of Pittsburgh - Film Studies.[256][257]

Moreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.[258][259][260][261][262] There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at the Carrie Furnace site in Rankin and Swissvale.[263]

The city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by George Westinghouse.[264] Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[265] and Pennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is provided by Equitable Gas, Columbia Gas, Dominion Resources, Direct Energy, and Novec.[266]

The two largest area health care providers are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network (since 1882). Both hospitals annually rank as among the best overall in the United States, with UPMC ranked among U.S. News & World Report's "Honor Roll" every year since 2000.[citation needed]

The first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[267] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first "Mercy Hospital".[268] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[26] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[269]

In 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.08 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[270] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[271] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($660 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[272] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[273]

The $80 million ($146 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($53.3 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($227 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($699 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[citation needed]

In 2009, the $600 million ($876 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[274] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[275] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[276]

While he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955.

UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[277] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[278][279]

The Lancet published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[280]

Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[281] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title "City of Bridges".[282] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The southwestern "entrance" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[283]

Pittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 minutes, while 23% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction.[284]

Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the "parkways." Interstate 376 is both the "parkway east" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the "parkway west" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The "parkway north" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The "crosstown" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped "beltway" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.

Pittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh.

Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh).

Amtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the Capitol Limited between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvanian to New York City.

Megabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[285]

Until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station.

Pittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[286] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an "incline") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[287] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[288] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.

The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the "T") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.

Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.

Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh.

The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011. The port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[289]

Pittsburgh's sister cities are:[290]



=== History of Pittsburgh - Wikipedia ===

The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Jaödeogë’ in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi.

Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow.  The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.  By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel.

Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the "Arsenal of Democracy", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.

Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities.

For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]

By 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds.  Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]

In 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29 km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]

Shannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]: 289

Sawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300–400 residents.[9]

The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]
Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Michael Cresap to begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail[12] now known as Nemacolin's Trail. The river crossing and flats at Redstone creek, was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified as Fort Burd (now Brownsville) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock's Road a few years later through present-day New Stanton. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track.

The nearby Native American community of Logstown was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley.[6] Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.[12] De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory.[13]

In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, an advance party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road through the woods and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.[14]

Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley, Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw.[15] Accompanied by Christopher Gist, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753.

As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, & the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common Surface of the Water; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timber'd Land all around it, very convenient for Building.

Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddie's letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and then Fort Le Boeuf. The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw.[15]

Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation[17] at the site of present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne.[14][15]

Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner.[18] After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chief Tanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity. These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), or, the Seven Years' War, a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres.[15][19]

In 1755, the Braddock Expedition was launched, accompanied by Virginia militia officer George Washington. Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountains. Braddock's Road, as it was known, blazed the way for the future National Road (US40). The expedition crossed the Monongahela River on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition at Braddock's Field, nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne.[20] In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded.[21] The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.[15]

On September 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning, and in the summer of 1758, British Army officer John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne.[21] At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford, from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13–14, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne.[21] The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers, "Pittsborough" (see Etymology of Pittsburgh).[11][15] The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.[11] The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat.[15] They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River.

In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the "lower town", near the fort's ramparts, and the "upper town", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]: 148

After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War. The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months.[15] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run.[21] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains.[15]

The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown.[21] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English-American, another third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others.[23] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.[23] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.[4]

Increasing violence, especially by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.[4]

With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.[4]

After the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.[24]

The village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.[25]

Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]

The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]

Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]

The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]

Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the "City of bridges" over its two rivers.[citation needed] On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia. In 1834, the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.[27]

Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high.[33]

Like many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.[34] Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages.[31] As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side).[27] In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]

The iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s.

Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was "largely Scotch Irish". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and "developed their own sense of uniqueness."[36]

New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813–1908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806–1882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the "Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society."[37]

In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]

Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh.  George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]

Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.[42]

Beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]

Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995).  Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44]

A further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley.   It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45]

By about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region.   Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46]

Christopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47]

During the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49]

As a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots.[50] Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.

In 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when Carnegie Steel Company's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike.  Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression, as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organized H.J. Heinz workers, with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance.

Andrew Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland and a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced.[51] He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]

The third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]

By 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]

During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.

During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term "Speakeasy", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]

The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]

During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]

In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]

To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed "Millionaire's Row" because of the many mansions lining the street.

On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]

Oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39]

Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[62] The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39]

The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.[63][64]
Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:

The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:

The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District. It became  an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s.[39]

Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,[67] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.[68][69]

Joseph Guffey, statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only "a challenge" but also "an opportunity". He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage.[70]

Pittsburgh was at the center of the "Arsenal of Democracy" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]

David Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]

Rich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the "Smoky City", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.  Civic leaders, notably Mayor David L. Lawrence, elected in 1945, Richard K. Mellon, chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin[74][75] began smoke control and urban revitalization, also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city[11] in unforeseen ways.

"Renaissance I" began in 1946.  Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin.  By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal.[27]

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[76] Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.

In the early 1960s, the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51 km2) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district.  In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979.

Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans.  The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage, including the Mexican War Streets, Allegheny West, and Manchester, were spared. The center of Allegheny City, with its culturally and socially important buildings, was not as lucky. All of the buildings, with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office, the Carnegie Library, and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the "pedestrianized" Allegheny Center Mall and apartments.

The city's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era[77] partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC.[78][79] Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s.[11] 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium.[27] In 1974, with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed.[80] Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.

Like most major cities, Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968. There were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods.[81]

During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini-mills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel.[citation needed] Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the 1973 oil crisis, and increasing use of other materials.[11][82]  The era began with the RIDC's "Building on Basics" report in 1974.[83]

Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable "mini-mills" and non-union mills with lower labor costs.[82]

Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S.[84] Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers.[82] The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed.[85][86] The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs.[87] Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.[88]

In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.

Top corporate headquarters such as Gulf Oil (1985), Koppers (1987), Westinghouse (1996) and Rockwell International (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the "brain drain") as well as massive charitable contributions by the "home based" companies to local cultural and educational institutions.  At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier.  Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day.

Today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the Edgar Thomson Works in nearby Braddock.

Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings, The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University.  Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.[89]  Other regional collegiate institutions include Robert Morris University, Chatham University, Carlow University,  Point Park University, La Roche College, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and the Community College of Allegheny County.

Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (26,000 employees) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System (13,000 employees).[90][91]

Despite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued.  In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation (Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies.  Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a 1-mile (1.6 km) long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh.  In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.  Aided by an initial generous gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River, opposite the Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh). Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people – teachers, students, adults, and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.[92]

During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.

In 1985, the J & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.[27] In the 1980s, the "Renaissance II" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as PPG Place. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared.[27] In 1992, the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened.[27] In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park, despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League.[93]

Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.[94]

Present-day Pittsburgh, with a diversified economy, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for medicine and  education and culture, has been ranked as one of the World's Most Livable Cities.[95] Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities.  Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry.[96] Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook, and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh.  As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies.  The region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center.  In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants, including from the Indian sub-continent. It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt.[97]

To be an amusement, the amusement must be offered to patrons at a place of amusement.

The location does not have to be owned or licensed to the Producer to be a place of amusement.  The common phrases used to describe an amusement and a place of 7  amusement change over time, but that change in common parlance does not affect the taxability of the amusement .  Specifically included within the term  of “places of amusement” are: cabarets, night clubs, roof gardens, lounges, entertainment stages, music or dancing halls, ball rooms, or other locations offering food or beverages or merchandise along with entertainment or recreation, as well as other loc ations that were taxable under Section 4231 of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (ignoring any exemptions or exclusions offered under that federal statute) as it was in effect immediately prior to its repeal by Public Law 89 - PRODUCER  – any person  conducting  any place  of amusement,  as herein  defined, where  the general  public  or a limited  or selected  number  thereof,  may,  upon  the payment  of an established  price, attend  or engage  in any amusement.

If persons  are admitted  at a reduced  rate, the tax imposed  shall be computed  on the reduced  rate paid.    However,  children  under  twelve  (12) years  of age, disabled  veterans  and members  of the armed  services  when  on active  duty and in uniform,  who are admitted  free of charge  to any place  of amusement,  shall not be required  to pay the tax imposed  by this Chapter.

d.

Where  any amusement  (entertainment)  is conducted  at a place  where  food and drink  are served  and there  is no fixed  charge  for admission,  the Amusement  Tax will be based  on 10% of the total amount  paid for food and drink.  For example,  if a check  for food and drink  by a party  of four amounts to $80.00,  the admission  charge  is 10% of  the total check,  or $8.00.

$8.00  admission  charge  X 5% = $ .40 Amusement  Tax.

2. If a cover  is required,  such  charge  shall be considered  as the regular established  price  paid for admission  and is taxable  as such.  If a total bill exceeds the cover charge, the total charge is taxable if it in fact represents  a charge  for admission.  If the same  charge  is made  to the person using or furnishing his own property  or equipment  as where  property  or equipment is furnished by the management, such charge is an amount  paid for admission and subject  to tax. If a lesser  charge  is made  to persons who  do not desire  to use the property  or services  offered,  the lesser  charge  represents the 3. Donations  and contributions  are taxable  as admission  charges  when  the amount  of the donation  and contributions  are stated  and when  such donations  or contributions  entitle  the donor  or contributors  to attend  or engage f.

Free admissions  granted  to such  persons who are not admitted  solely  for the purpose  of performing their  special  duties in connection  with the event  are subject  to the tax equivalent  to the tax on the admission  charge  paid by other  persons  for the same or similar 13  3.

SEASON  TICKETS  – where  patrons  have  the use of boxes  or seats  pursuant  to section  241.04(c)  of the Pittsburgh  Code  and are required  to pay the entire season  price  at the time the seating  is acquired,  the Producer  shall collect  the tax imposed  herein  and remit  it at the time the reservation  of the seating  is made  by the patron,  that is, in advance  of the season’s  amusement.

d. MONTHLY  REPORT  – every  Producer , except  as hereinafter  provided,  conducting a place  of amusement,  on or before  the fifteenth  day of each  month,  shall transmit on a form prescribed  by the Treasurer,  a report  under  oath or affirmation  of the amount  of tax collected  during  the preceding  month.

(Ord.  38-1991,  eff. 11-25-91).

g. When  the City of Pittsburgh’s  Amusement  Tax is included  in the total collections from patrons , the formula  for the Amusement  Tax is: 1.00 admission  charge  + .05 tax rate 1.05 admission  charge  + tax rate The Amusement Tax is deemed included in the Established Price charged the patron if the Producer does not  separately state the Amusement Tax on any ticket or receipt as required by Section 303 , or if no receipt or ticket is issued to the patron.

A = .05 tax rate      X $20.00  Total 1.00 admission  charge  + .05 tax rate A = .05 tax rate      X $20.00  Total 1.05 admission  charge  + tax rate A = .04762  X $20.00  Total Total  admission  charge  is $20.00  x .04762  = $ .95 tax or $19.05  – Admission  Charge $ .95 tax = 5% of admission  charge  before  taxes $20.00  – Total  (Admission  Charge  + Amusement  Tax) SECTION  302 – RECORDS In general  each  place  of amusement  must  maintain  complete  and accurate  records  of all transactions,  the total amount  of consideration  received  from all transactions  and the total amount  of tax collected  on the basis  of such  considerations.  Records  to be kept must consist  of, but are not limited  to a monthly  summary  showing  the starting  and ending ticket  numbers  for each  series,  the number  of tickets  sold at each  representative  price  and the amount  of tax collected.

Where  an amusement  is included  in the price  of food and drink  the place  of amusement shall total the amount  of sales,  on the cash  register,  prior to the amusement.  The place  of amusement  shall begin  a new cash  register  tape that will end when  the place  of amusement  ends.  If the place  of amusement  does  not do this it will pay on the 24 hour period  of the day that the amusement  occurred.  Once  the total sales  have  been calculated  from the place  of amusement,  the admission  charge  equals  the amount  paid for food and drink  times  ten percent.  The imputed  Amusement  Tax equals  the admission charge  times  five percent.

16  The amount paid for food and drink  x 10% = THE ADMISSION  CHARGE The admission  charge  x 5% = THE IMPUTED  AMUSEMENT  TAX Records  to be kept shall include  part of each  serial  numbered  ticket  used  at each  place  of amusement  issued  to each  patron  and copies  of all leases  or contracts  or agreements supporting  the transactions  for permanent  use of boxes  or seats  in any place  of SECTION  303 - TICKET  LABELING a. DELINEATING  THE AMUSEMENT  TAX – for each  admission  subject  to the collection  of a tax pursuant  to the provisions  of Chapter  241, the Producer  shall cause  to be printed  clearly  on the face of any ticket,  receipt  or any other  token purchased  by a patron  for the purpose  of admission  to an amusement  the following 1. The established  price  of admission; 2. The amount  of amusement  tax due on line 1; and 3. The sum of lines 1 and 2.

b. SIGNS  – every  place  of amusement  must  maintain,  conspicuously  posted  at the entrance,  and near the box-office  a place  at which  the established  price  is paid, one (1) or more signs accurately stating: 1. The established  price  of admission; 2. The amount  of amusement  tax due on line 1; and 3. The sum total of the established  price  and the tax.

FAILURE  TO COMPLY  – in the event  that a Producer  fails to comply  with the ticketing and labeling  provisions  of Section  241.07(a)  the Producer  shall be subject  to the suspension  and/or  revocation  of his amusement  permit  pursuant  to section  241.03(c)  of the Pittsburgh Code. (Ord. 34-1994,  eff. 12-30-94).  The failure to comply with the ticketing and labeling provisions will not excuse the Producer  from timely remitt ing the deemed collected Amusement Tax.

SECTION  304 – AMUSEMENT  TAX QUESTIONS  AND  ANSWERS Q. – Are admissions  to a movie  theater  not taxed if provided by an  Institution  of Purely Public  Charity?  Is a movie theater  considered  a Performing  Art?

A. – No.  Admissions to a movie theater are not considered a Performing Art because it is not a live performance , and nor would they be considered an Exempt Performing Arts Q. – Does  a Producer of home  builders’  show s, trade shows,  or similar exhibitions  have  to collect the Amusement  Tax?

A. – The admission  receipts  from a home  builders’  show  are properly  subject  to the Amusement  Tax. The Amusement  Tax Chapter  241 of the Pittsburgh  Code  extends,  by 17  definition  to trade  shows  and similar  exhibitions.

Q. – Does  a Producer of wine tasting, beer tasting, whisky tasting, food tasting or similar events have  to collect the Amusement  Tax?

A. – The admission  receipts  from a tasting event are properly  subject  to the Amusement Tax, if the event is primarily intended to showcase a commercial product  or products , even if no live entertainment or recreation is provided.  However, if the Producer does not provide entertainment or recreation, but does collect sales taxes or drin k taxes, based on the admission charge or contribution, from the patron, then the event is an Exempt Amusement.

A tasting event is not an Exempt Amusement even if historical or educ ational material is provided to the patron if such historical or educational material is not the primary purpose Q. – A bar with entertainment  has a cover  charge  of $10.00  with the Amusement  Tax included.  How much  is the Amusement  Tax?

A. - $10.00  cover  charge  X .04762  = $0.48 Amusement  Tax.

Q. – A bar with entertainment  has no cover  charge,  is any Amusement  Tax owed?  If so, how is it calculated?

A. – The Amusement  Tax is owed.  The cover  charge  shall be imputed  per the City Code.

The amount  paid for admission  to the amusement  shall be ten (10%)  percent  of the amount  paid for refreshment,  service  and merchandise.  (The food and drink  for a bar).

The place  of amusement  must  begin  a new cash  register  tape that will end when  the place  of amusement  ends.  Once  you have  the total sales  from the place  of amusement you are ready  to impute  the admission  charge.

The amount  paid for food and drink  X 10% = the admission  charge.  The admission  charge X 5% = the imputed  amusement tax.

An imputed  admission  charge  is implied,  and the tax will be collected.  An implied  charge is one that the place  of amusement  would  normally  collect.  The admission  charge  is therefore  imputed  and the tax paid by the place  of amusement.

SECTION  401 – POWERS  AND  DUTIES  OF TREASURER  (DIRECTOR) a. It shall be the duty of the Treasurer  to collect  and receive  the taxes,  fines,  and penalties  imposed  by the City Code,  Title Two,  Article  VII, Chapter  241.

If records  are not available  in the City of Pittsburgh  to support the returns which were filed or which  should  have  been  filed,  the Producer  will be required  to make  them available  to the Treasurer  either  by producing  them  in a City of Pittsburgh  location  or by paying  for the expenses  incurred  by the Treasurer  in traveling  to the place  where the records  are regularly  kept.

c. Any information  gained  by the Treasurer,  by designated  agents,  or by any other official  or agent  of the City of Pittsburgh,  as a result  of any declarations,  returns, investigations,  hearings  or verifications  required  or authorized  by the City Code, shall be confidential  except  for official  purposes  and shall not be released  except  in accordance  with a proper  judicial  order,  or as otherwise  provided  by law.

SECTION  404 – AUDITS If, as a result  of an examination  conducted by the Treasurer, a return  is found  to be incorrect, the Treasurer  is authorized  to assess  and collect  any underpayments  of the Amusement Tax.  If no return  has been  filed and a tax is found  to be due, the tax actually  due may be assessed  and collected  with or without  the formality  of obtaining  a return  from the producer .

Deficiency  assessments  (i.e., where  producer  has filed a return  but is found  to owe additional  tax) shall include  taxes  for up to three (3) years  prior to the date when  the deficiency  is assessed.  Where no return  was filed,  there  shall be no limit to the period  of SUITS  FOR TAX COLLECTIONS, VIOLATIONS,  FINES, INTEREST & SECTION  501 – REMEDIES  NOT MUTUALLY  EXCLUSIVE The remedies  provided  in Section  502 or Section  505 are not mutually  exclusive.   The utilization  by the Treasurer  of one remedy  does  not preclude  utilization  of the other.

Moreover, use of either or both of the remedies  provided in  these  Sections  does  not preclude  the use by the City of Pittsburgh  of any other  legal or administrative procedure which  can bring  about  compliance  by the Producer  with the provisions  of Chapter  241 of the Pittsburgh  Code  and these regulations.

Once it has been determined that that a Producer  owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all actions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional information, auditing Producer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of the tax, or obtaining liens on the Producer ’s property, wage attachments, levies, and seizures and sales of the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer may enter  into a written agreement with the Producer for payment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer may also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek cri minal charges in appropriate circumstances.

SECTION  502 – SUITS  FOR  RECOVERY  OF UNPAID  TAXES The Treasurer  may sue in the name of the City of  Pittsburgh, in law or in equity, for the recovery  of those  taxes  due and unpaid  under  the provisions  of the Amusement  Tax, to compel  the production  of records  or to enforce  any other  provisions  of the law.  Such suits may also be brought against Responsible Persons.

SECTION  503 - LIMITATIONS a. The following  periods  of limitations  shall apply  to suits for collection  of taxes.

If, however,  any Producer  shall fail to make any report  and payment  as herein  required  a penalty  at the rate of five (5%)  percent per month  for each  month  or a fraction  of a whole  month  on the amount  of tax and interest  of one (1%)  percent  per month  for each  month  or fraction  of a whole  month during  the period  in which  the tax remains  unpaid  shall be added  to the tax.

Should the Producer fail to timely remit the Amusement Tax due to the City, the Treasurer may assess and collect any unpaid Amusement Tax directly from any Responsible Person  or from the Producer, or both .  A Responsible  Person can show he is not liable for any collected Amusement Tax if he shows the Amusement T ax has been properly refunded to the Patron s who paid the tax .

I rrespective of the common law tests for determining the existence of an independent contractor relationship, an individual performing work or service for Compensation shall be deemed to be an Employee of the person for whom the work or service is performed unless: (1) such i ndividual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such work or service, under his/her appointment of contract of hire or apprenticeship; (2) such work or service is outside the usual course of the business of  the person for which such service is performed; or, (3) such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, business or profession.   A Partner or Self - employed person is not an Employee.

A Partnership is an Employer a s to its Employees and as to any of its Partners providing service in the City.  A Partner, conducting one or more business es within the City through a Partnership , where the Partnership  does not file a Payroll Tax return with the City, is an Employer.   Any Self -Employed Person conducting one or more Business within the City is an Employer.

Any person who is classified as an em ployer under the Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax statute is an Employer under these regulations. 72 P.S. § 7301 (h).  The term Employer includes any person that makes an election under 26 U.S.C. § 3504 to act as a payroll agent , or any person who  both with holds and  remits the City local earned income tax, 53 P.S. § 6924.501 , or the City local services tax, 53 P.S. § 6924.301.1(9) (v), on behalf of another.   53 P.S. § 6924.303(j).

For example, a payroll reporting company that is not a common law employer of the workers of another unless it is: (a) an employer of those workers under 72 P.S. § 7301(h) or (b) the joint employer of th ose workers.

EXEMPT EMPLOYER  – any person that is a Governmental Entity .  A contractor or consultant , classified as a Partner , a Self -employed person,  or a person receiving Form 1099 -MISC, providing services to an Exempt Employer is not itself exempt  merely because he or she derives service revenue from a Governmental Entity .

GUARANTEED PAYMENTS  – payments to Partners by the Partnership for services that are determined without regard to th e net income of the Partnership.  For example, health insurance premiums paid by the Partnership on behalf of any Partner are Guaranteed Payments because they are determined without regard to the net income of the Partnership.

-5-  GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY  – any ag ency, authority, department, or instrumentality of the federal government or of another State, and any unit of government listed under 1 01 Pa. Code INTERNAL REVENUE CODE – the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public Law 99 - 514), as amended , 26 U.S.C. § 1, and following, as it was in effect on January 1, 20 20.

NET DISTRIBUTION – the am ount of a Partner’s or Self -employed person’s draws from net income from one or more Business es that have activities in the City shall be reported for the Payroll Expense Tax.   For purposes of this regulation,  TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS  are limited by the sum of draws or net income for that Partner  or Self -employed person , whichever is less.

If the Partner’s or Self -Employed person’s Net Distribution exceeds that individual ’s share of net profit s from a particular Business , the excess draw is a return of capita l. A return of capital is not taxable because this is a liquidation of a Partner’s or Self-employed person’s assets by the owner .  A Partner’s Taxable Distribution s shall include a partner’s share of Guaranteed Payments from the Partnership.   Taxable Distr ibutions shall be determined using the same tax accounting method used to report taxable income for Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax purposes, Tax Reform Code of 1971.   Taxable Distributions from a Business are presumed to be derived from the current year’ s net income of that Business.

PARTNER  – an individual owner or member in a Partnership.   A Partner will owe tax based on Taxable Distributions.  A Partner is not taxed on his or her Passive Income.

PARTNERSHIP – an unincorporated entity, joint venture, business trust, general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, syndicate, or any other unincorporated association , with two or more owners that is taxed for Pennsylvania state income purposes as a pass -through entity.   Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7401 (definition of a “Corporation”).

An unincorporated entity , with one owner,  that is treated under the federal “check -the-box” as a disregarded entity is not a Partnership.  26 C.F.R. § 301.7701 -3 (as it was in effect on January 1, 2 020).  See, Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7307.21.   An unincorporated entity, with one or more owners, that has made the federal “check -the-box” election to be taxed as a “corporation” is not a Partnership but it may be an Employer.

PASSIVE INCOME  – Items of i ncome earned by a Partner or Self -employed person from interest  (not derived from working capital investments) , dividends, capital  gains  (except for an individual who is considered a trader and not an investor) , ground rents, royalties associated with the development of natural resources  through a non -operating interest , retirement income earned after retirement, and real estate rental income where substantial services are not provided to tenants , is non-taxable Passive Income.  In determining whet her any portion of net profits from a Business may constitute Compensation or non -taxable Passive Income, the Treasurer will follow the guidance issued under Tax Refo rm Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7303 (a), and the PA Personal Income Tax Return Guide, except wh ere such guidance is inconsistent with the purposes of the Payroll Tax .  Income earned by a Partner  or by a Self -employed person , is not Passive Income if the business provides professional services (e.g. law, accounting, architectural, professional engine ering, actuarial, or medical services) or personal services to customers, unless the Partner or Self -Employed person is retired , based on age or years of service,  and does not provide services to the business .  Guaranteed Payments made to a Partner are not  Passive Income.   Payments made to a retiring Partner under Section 736 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 736, are Passive Income.   The Passive Income -6-  exclusion only applies to Partners and Self -employed persons, but not to Employees whose Compensa tion is reported to the taxing authorities on a Form W -2 or Form 1099 -MISC.

PAYROLL EXPENSE – the total Compensation paid, including salaries, wages, net distributions, commissions, bonuses, stock options and other compensation to all individuals who duri ng any tax year, perform work or render services in whole or in part in the City of Pittsburgh. Employee contributions and deductions resulting from an employee election, whether deferred or otherwise, to qualified cash or deferred arrangements, such as an Internal Revenue Code Section 401( k) retirement plan or Internal Revenue Code Section 125 “cafeteria plan” , do not reduce total Compensation . Compensation meeting the definition of earned income would be part of the Payroll Expense Tax  associated with a  particular Employee  who is not a Partner or a Self -employed person .  Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.501 (“Earned Income”).  The Payroll Tax is on gross payroll  of the Employer .  The Employers’ portions of federal and state payroll taxes, health insu rance  premiums , retirement plan contributions , etc., are not  part of taxable  gross payroll.

The Payroll Expense of a Partner or Self -employed person is the cumulative annual  Taxable Distributions associated with each separate Business  carried on w ithin the Ci ty rather than “Earned Income” as defined in 53 P.S. § 6924.501.

PERSON – a corporation, Partnership, Partner, Self-employed individual, business trust, association, unincorporated entity, estate, trust, foundation or natural person. Whenever used in any provision prescribing a fine or penalty the word “person” as applied to Partnerships, shall mean  the Partners thereof, and as applied to corporations and unincorporated associations, shall mean the officers thereof.   A Governmental Entity  is not a Pe rson.

SELF -EMPLOYED  – an individual  who earns  Compensation from one or more separate Business es carried on within the City , other than as an Employee or as a Partner.  The single member owner of a n unincorporated entity that is treated as disregarded entity under the federal “check -the-box” regulations, 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701 -3 (as it was in effect on January 1, 2020), is treated as Self -Employed and not as a Partner.  The Compensation of a Self- employ ed individual shall be that person’s Taxable Distributions from each separate business reported on Schedules C, E, or F of the Pennsylvania individual income tax Form PA -40, as well as any other non-employee Compensation , which is not otherwise reported on  Schedules C, E, or F.  Passive Income  of a Self -employed person is not subject to the Payroll Tax .  If the Self-Employed person does not keep records of Taxable Distrib utions, the entire net income of each separate Business  is presumed to be a Taxable Dis tribution.  Any individual who is classified as an Employee, because of the control exercised by the Employer, is not Self - Employed as to any Compensation associated with that particular Business.

TAX YEAR – a twelve -month period from January 1 to December 31.

TAXPAYER – a person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity required hereunder to file a return of payroll expense, or to pay a tax thereon.  An Employer , Partner,  or Self Employed person are a Taxpayer.   An Exempt Employer is not a Taxpayer.

The City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 258, imposes a Payroll Tax on all persons that engage, hire, employ or contract with one or more individuals, as employees, to perform work or render services within the City of Pittsburgh. The Payroll Tax is computed on the employer’s payroll  expense .  The Payroll Tax on Partners and Self - Employed is computed based on Taxable Distributions  from any Business es.

d. For employers whose employees perform work or render services partly within and partly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, the method of computing their payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh is to use the perce ntage of the total number of working hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of working hours employed within and outside of the City of Pittsburgh for each individual employee.   Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303( a).

e. Employers who have payroll expense consisting of work done within and outside of the boundaries of the City of Pittsburgh , but who do not regularly maintain records showing hours worked so as to be able to use the apportionment method under subsection (d) of this regulation,  may use a representative test period or conduct a survey based on factual data to arrive at a formula with which to calculate the percentage of payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh. Any formula so established will be subject to review and correction by the City of Pittsburgh. A thorough description explaining the formula shall be attached to the first return each year. The data supporting the formula shall be maintained for at least three (3) years as a part of offi ce records for audit and f. Partners and Self -Employed individuals who have Taxable Distributions generated from intrastate sales or services partly within the City of Pittsburgh or partly outside the City of Pittsburgh shall report on the  Taxable Distributions  associated with sales or services rendered within the City of Pittsburgh. Where it is impractical to determine the exact Taxable Distributions , an apportionment formula may be used. Any formula so established will be subject to review a nd correction by the City of Pittsburgh Finance Department. The data supporting the formula must be maintained as a part of office records for audit and review purposes. A thorough description explaining the formula shall be attached to the first return ea ch year. The data supporting the formula shall be maintained for at least three  (3) years as a part of office records for audit and review g. Partners and Self -employed individuals who have Compensation from sources within and without Pennsylvania , may apportion their Compensation to the City using the formula used reporting personal income tax on Form PA -40, 61 Pa. Code § 109.5, by substituting the  word  “City” for the “Commonwealth”  where necessary.   In making that calculation, a ll intrastate sale s and services within Pennsylvania are deemed allocated to the City if the Partner ’s or Self -employed individual ’s sole office in Pennsylvania is -8-  located in the City.

In the event that a person who discontinues Business during any tax quarter does so before payment of the tax becomes due for such tax quarter, said person may apportion the tax and pay an amount to be computed by multiplying the Payroll Expense for the preceding tax quarter by a fraction whose numerator shall be the number of days such person was in Business during the current tax quarter and whose deno minator shall be the total number of days in the current quarter. The final return shall be due ten (10) days after the discontinuation of Business.   Self-employed individuals and Partners are considered to have discontinued their Business only if all sepa rate Businesses of the individual are discontinued.

f.

(d) Receipts associated with interstate commerce shall be apportioned to the City by multiplying total receipts earned everywhere times the City Apportionment percentage.

-6-  EXAMPLES FOR LOCAL SERVICE TAX (LST) 1. How is the LST deducted from the employee’s pay and remitted to the City? Example, employees work full time in the City and all employees earn $12,000 or more.  What is the employer’s  responsibility?

ANSWER:  The employer is required to withhold the pro -rata share of the tax by dividing $52 by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year.

The $52 tax would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly or at $4.33 per month for taxpayers paid monthly. When calculat ing the pro -rata share, employers are required to round down to the nearest one -hundredth of a dollar.

The employer must remit the LST quarterly. The LST form is provided by the City. The tax should be paid the month following the end of each quarter. The  LST forms can be downloaded  at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance 2. At the beginning of the year, an employee expects to earn a total of $10,000 in the City for the entire  calendar  year.  Should  the employer  withhold  the LST?

ANSWER: No. If an employee files an exemption certificate with his employer stating that he will earn less than $12,000 for the entire year, the employer is not required to withhold the LST.  The employer is required to have the exemption certificate available for employees to  complete.

The exemption certificate can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/fin ance 3. A new hire files an exemption certificate with his employer. The employer and his employee realize with 13 weeks left in the year that he will earn $12,000 because he is working more hours than anticipated. He is paid weekly. Is his employer responsib le for withholding the LST now?

ANSWER: Yes. After the employer realizes that the employee will  earn  $12,000  or more, the employer must withhold $40 ($39 + $1) from the next pay to catch -up then $1.00 a pay for the remaining 12 pays for a grand total of  $52.

4. Employee has two part -time jobs; one located in the City which pays him $8,000 a year and another in Municipality “A” that pays him $7,000 a year. Does this person need to ANSWER: No.  The taxpayer should file an exemption certificate w ith both employers and have  no LST deducted.  The Taxpayer  is not subject  to the LST since  he did not earn $12,000 in any single municipality. If the tax was withheld the employee could file a refund claim with each municipality after January 31 of the following year. The refund request form can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance  - the form is listed  as LST REFUND  FORM.

5. An individual works January thru June in the City and July thru December in Municipality “A”. He earns $10,000 a month at both jobs and is paid once a week. What is his liability ANSWER: His employer in the City should withhold $1 a week for 26 pay periods and remit $26 along with his other employees’ deductions to the City. Municipality “A” would be entitled to the LST for the 2nd half of the year. The emp loyee should provide proof of LST paid for the first half of the year to Municipality “A”.

-7-  6. An individual works July thru December in the City. He did not work January thru June, anywhere. He earns $10,000 a month. Does he owe the $52 LST to t he City?

ANSWER: Yes. His employer knows that this employee is over  the  $12,000  low income exemption level. No exemption certificate has been filed. The $52 may be prorated for the rest of the year; however the employer should withhold $52 because that is what  the employee  owes.

SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the prior periods that were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current payroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid once a week, h e would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be deducted from one paycheck.

7. An employee has 2 jobs and both are part time. Both started at the beginning of January.

Job #1 is in the City and pays the employee $1,000 a month. Job #2 is in Municipality “A” and paid the taxpayer $500. Where should the tax be  paid?

ANSWER: Since both jobs started at the same time, the job that pays the employee the most should be considered his principal job and in this case it would be the City. The LST shoul d be paid to the City. The employee should file an exemption certificate with Municipality “A” or proof that his principal employer is located in the City.

8. On January 1, an employee worked for an employer in Municipality “A” and paid $10. In June the emplo yee started a new job in the City and will make over $12,000 at this job.

Is the employer  required  to withhold  the LST from the employee?

ANSWER: Yes. The employer must still withhold $42 ($52 less $ 10 previously paid) if the employee provides proof that the $10 was paid to Municipality “A”. Then the employer must pro -rate the $42  based on the remaining payroll  periods.

SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the prior periods that  were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current payroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid once a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be deducted from one p aycheck.

9. An employee files his exemption certificate late. The employer has already withheld $52.

Can the employee  apply  for a refund?

ANSWER: Yes. The employee should request the refund from the employer. It is permissible and recommended that his employe r refund the current year LST and make an adjustment for their next quarterly remittance to the City for the current year.

If the employer does not refund the LST, the employee can apply for a refund from the City after the employer’s fourth quarter paymen t and summary form is filed at the end of January of the following year (see Section 301(j)).

The City is not required to pay interest until 75 days after the fourth quarter or when the taxpayer files for a refund, whichever is later.

-7-  10. Employe e works 4 months in the City and earns $20,000. His employer  is  located outside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Is the employee required to pay the $52 11. Is a self -employed person or a  partner who has an office in the City or who works out of his home  located in the City subject to the  LST?

ANSWER:  Yes.   A self -employed person or partner is subject to the $52   LST.  The tax may be  prorated and paid  quarterly.

COLLECTION AT SOUR CE SECTION 301 – COLLECTION THROUGH EMPLOYERS a. Every employer not registered with the City shall, within 15 days after first becoming an employer, register with the City the employer’s name, address and such other information as the City may  require.

Exemption certificates must indicate a basis for exemption  and must  be retained  for 3 years.

c. Employers are required to remit the Local Services Tax within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year. For purposes of this tax, sole proprietors and partners  shall be deemed  to be employees.

Any employer, who discontinues business or ceases operation before December 31 of the current tax year, shall within fifteen (15) days after discontinuing business or ceasing operation,  file the return  hereinabove  required  and pay the tax to the Treasurer.

e. The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the employee from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. The employee must first contact the City of Pittsburgh Finance Department at 412-255-2510 then file an LS -3 form. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the Local Services Tax to a political subdivision if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the employee’s place or places of employmen t. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax as required by this section, or who fails to pay the tax to the Treasurer,  shall be liable  for -8-  As to employees who present official receipts evidencing prior payment of the tax either directly or by collection through other employers in Pennsylvania, the employer shall not deduct the tax but shall maintain adequate records concerning the employees.

f. The employer must list on the employee’s pay stub how much was withheld and list the municipality it was paid to . List PITTSBURGH as  “PGH ”.

g. Upfront Exemption . Employers are required to discontinue withholding the LST if an employee provides an exemption certificate showing that he has earned income and/or net profits of less than $12,000. The exemption certificate must verify that the employee reasonably expec ts to receive earned income and/or net profits of less than $12,000 from all sources within the City for the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed.

A copy of the employee’s final pay stubs or W -2 forms from employment within Pittsburgh for the year prior to the calendar year for which the employee is requesting an exemption must be attached to the exemption certificate. Employers must make upfront exemption forms readily available to employees at all times and provide new employees with  the forms at the time of hiring. Employers are relieved of liability due to incorrect information on the exemption  certificate  completed  by the employee.

Employers are only required to withhold the LST on a payroll period basis for those payroll periods i n which the taxpayer is employed. However, when two or more  employers employ a taxpayer in a payroll period, an employer is not required to withhold the LST if the taxpayer provides a pay stub from his/her principal employer accompanied by an employee stat ement of principal employment that the pay stub is from the taxpayer’s principal employer and that the taxpayer will notify the employer of any change in employment.  Employers  are relieved  of liability  for the tax if they fail to withhold  the tax due to incorrect information provided by the taxpayer regarding the taxpayer’s principal h. Military Exemption . Employers must exempt from the LST: (1) members of a reserve component of the armed forces called to active duty and (2) honorably discha rged veterans who served in any war or armed conflict who are blind, paraplegic, or a double or quadruple amputee as a result of military service or who are 100% disabled from a service -connected  disability.

i. Restoration of Withholding . Employers must “rest art” withholding the LST from an employee  who files an exemption  certificate  in the following  circumstances:  If instructed  to do so by the political  subdivision  levying  the LST;  If notified  by the employee  that he is no longer  eligible  for the exemption;  or  If the employer  pays  the employee  $12,000  or more  for the calendar  year.

Employers “restart” withholding of the LST by withholding (1) a “catch -up” lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the employee as a result of the exemption; and (2) the same amount per payroll period that is withheld from other j. The employer must attach a summary on a CD or hard copy with the fourth quarter payment  listing  the following  information:  Employer’s name, address in Pittsburgh, Federal ID number, and the employer’s City -9-   The summary must include an employee’s name, Social Security number, wages, address and the amount of Local Service Tax withheld and paid to Pittsburgh for the complete calendar  year.

Where  the taxpayer  is employed  that is nearest  in miles  to the taxpayer’s  home.

k. If any employer fails or refuses to pay over to the Treasurer any tax required to be withheld under this section by the due date, a penalty of 5% for every month or fraction thereof that the tax remains unpaid shall be added and collected, the penalty is c apped at 50%.

Any taxes deducted and withheld from employees, plus any penalties and interest thereon, constitute a  trust fund for the benefit of the City. The failure to timely remit such funds allows the City to collect such trust funds from the employer, the employer’s representative, or any other person receiving such trust funds.  53 P.S. § 6924.705(b)(1).

The failure or omission of any employer to make the correct deductions required by this section shall not relieve any employee from the payment of the tax or the balance determined to be due, together with penalty and interest from the date the tax was due , or from complying with the requirements of the Code relating to the filing of declarations and returns.

Such  action  may include  obtaining  additional  information, auditing taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of the tax, or obtaining liens on the taxpayer’s property, wage attachmen ts, levies, and seizures and sales of the taxpayer’s  property  in appropriate  circumstances.  The Treasurer  may enter  into a written agreement with the taxpayer for payment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will faci litate collection.

A tax for general  revenue  purposes  is hereby  imposed  upon  each parking  transaction  by a patron  of a non-residential  parking  place  at the rate of thirty -seven  and one-half (37.5)  percent  for all transactions  occurring  on or after January  1, 2009.  The rate of tax may be changed  for any tax year by the legislative  actions  of the Mayor and City Council.   However, the tax rate may not exceed the rate permitted by the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act , 53 P.S. § 895.902.

(b) Calculation  of tax. The following  method  must  be used  to compute  the tax, whether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where individual  tax collections  are not kept for each  ticket : Simplified Calculation .  For ease of administration and tax collection,  the tax return presumes that gross collections include both total consideration from the patron and collected parking tax  from the patron . Under this simplified calculation the applicable tax rates is 27.273% times gross collections.

The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as follows: Parking  Fee X Tax Rate  = Parking  Tax Due For example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%: $1,000.00  X 37.5%  = $375.00 $1,550.00  X 37.5%  = $581.25 (c) Calculation  of total  payment.  The following  method  shall be used  to compute the total payment  collected  by the  operator  and paid by the  patron,  whether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are not kept for each  ticket.  The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as Parking  Fee + Parking  Tax = Total  Payment For example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%: $1,000.00  + $375.00  = $1,375.00 $1,550.00  + $581.25  = $2,131.25 (d) Calculation  of total  payment where  there  is a surcharge.  The following method shall be used  to compute  the total payment  collected  by the operator  and paid by the patron  when  a surcharge  is imposed,  whether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are not kept for each ticket.  The parking  tax will be applied  to the sum of the base  parking  fee and the surcharge.  The rate of  tax is defined above  and will be applied  as follows: -11-  (Base  Fee + Surcharge)   + Tax Rate(Base Fee  + Surcharge) = Total  Payment For example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%  and the surcharge  is $10: ($1,000.00  + $10.00)  + $378.75  = $1,388.75 ($1,550.00  + $10.00)  + $585.00  = $2,145.00 § 302.

The Smiley :-) was created by Carnegie Mellon research professor Scott Fahlman on September 19, 1982. This was the beginning of emoticons in email, and the precursor to emojis.

Carnegie Mellon alumnus Andy Warhol was an iconic figure in the pop art movement that explored the relationship of art to modern celebrity culture and advertising. His work included hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film and music. A pioneer in computer-generated art, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.

It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts. The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named "Win-Win: How to Get What You Want," started with Carnegie Mellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful — and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject: Women Don't Ask and Ask for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want.

In 1979, Carnegie Mellon established the nation's first Robotics Institute. Since then, professor and alumnus William "Red" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to clean up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race. Technologies like these can help make driving safer by preventing accidents.

The Mayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote. City Council’s nine representatives are elected to office by residents in each of their respective districts.

The Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or fraudulent practices. Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with reporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City’s fiscal condition. Every year, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information on Pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook.

City Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also approves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital Budgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of City government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.

City Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk. The City Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information resource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget Division monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations.  It prepares and distributes to Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City of Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special reports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.

The Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly responsible for much of the City’s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices, Bureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to debt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law acts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella organizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and Safety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations, Environmental Services, and Facilities.

Additionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City’s managerial hierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City’s General Fund. For this reason, these Authorities are not included in the Operating Budget.

A comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart presented in this document. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide What is the Operating Budget?

The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are figures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are spread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the administration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and programming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the routine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’ compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.

The City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are collected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses, charges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other revenue generating mechanisms.

The Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what governmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal year. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.

The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and Members of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the City of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of Pittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire through tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the City. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits priorities set by the City’s elected public officials.

Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the City of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating Budget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial creation of the plan.

The General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.

The City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of each year. This can only be changed by ordinance.

Balanced Budget Mandate The City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues equal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year, the budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide The City’s Fund Structure In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City’s financial reporting system is organized on a fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.

Capital Projects Fund Community Development Funds Special Revenues Funds The General Fund  is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain most of the City’s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general The Capital Projects Fund  is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or program (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to provide a long-term benefit to the City. All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum value of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from three major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on the Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 Capital Budget document.

Community Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and human services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.

Special Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or committed for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership Fund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for two of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word “trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the funds are not held by any trustees or custodians.

Fiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These resources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh’s own operations and are custodial in nature. The City’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.

• The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for firefighters, and a third for municipal employees.

• Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax refunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other Post-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of This budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that comprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide The City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and Elected Office. These accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the Fund ...Cost Center ...Subclass ...Object Account The legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101.

Annual City of Pittsburgh revenue is generated by both tax and non-tax sources. There are seven subclasses.

42  License and Permit Revenue 43  Charges for Services 44  Fines and Forfeitures 45  Intergovernmental Revenue 46  Interest Earnings 47  Miscellaneous Revenues Taxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues. In addition to wage and property taxes, there are many that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City.

They are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.

Real estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School District, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within the City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property Assessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2023, the City real estate tax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax rate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny County Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).

Other sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax, the Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the Deed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax.

Earned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2 percent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security, and capital gains are commonly excluded.

The Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh’s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied at the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed individuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide services within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide Finally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of Pittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051.

In 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76.5 percent of total City revenue.

City of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for the improvement of the City's parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Stop the Violence Trust Fund  section for more information.

“Non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not directly involve the levying of taxes. Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction permits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as interest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.

Each year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of grants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account consists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most intergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. Local entities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal agencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the quality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden.

Many City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. Examples of these fees include payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale of rights of way. In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and governmental entities. For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to receive medical care.

In 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23.5 percent of total City revenue.

How Does the City Spend Money?

The tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents ranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. Expenditures are monitored by department or division and by subclass.

Major expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for City of Pittsburgh employees. The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past and current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. The chart below illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) contributions, health insurance and workers’ compensation.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide $ (Millions)Select Major Expenditures, 2018-2022 2021 2022Health Insurance Workers' CompensationPension and OPEBDebt Service050,000,000100,000,000150,000,000 These expenditures are categorized within the Personnel – Employment Benefits subclass.

Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of Finance and is composed of the following accounts: 82101  Interest Expense - Bonds Budget Creation Process The operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations, policy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by After receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit proposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements, requests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the proposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if any, should be funded.

The Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to garner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor’s strategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.

City Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After consideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a vote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st.  Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of the new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to collective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before December 31st was 1931.

Upon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating and Capital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City’s expenditures and revenues, provides legislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments.

Analysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure categories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important management initiatives.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide Five-Year Financial Forecast In addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both expenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise the five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.

The five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This aids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long- term impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for long-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might result in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus ensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.

Revenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and deliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the rights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Projected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.

The Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts.

Previous years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of- year financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue line. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.

In addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic variables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue generating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the National Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.

Revenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are developed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are reasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections are finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.

Expenditure Forecast OMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these forecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known expenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension contributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).

OMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and initiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are subject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This is accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend, Lastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described above. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in achieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests and evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that fall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide How to Read the Budget Throughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. In general, each separate section of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference between each report within a section.

Departmental Sections The most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in the Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been appropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the Departmental Sections of the Operating Budget. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide The organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau, or Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with the exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions.

Departmental Overview At the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the organization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the department. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency, Bureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed.

The position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or “FTE,” represents the number of full-time workers in the position. The “Rate/Grade” category indicates how an employee’s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees can be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a “12” in the “Hours/Months” column indicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or ending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The “Budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The “Vacancy Allowance” adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions throughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons.

This portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass and object account level. For example, the general “Professional and Technical Services” subclass will highlight the appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as “Administrative Fees,” “Workforce Training,” and “Computer Maintenance.” Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted expenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024 Under the Personnel – Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular  salary represents the total base pay for the organization. Longevity  pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining agreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances  are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform  allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs are listed accordingly. Leave Buyback  represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the City. Premium Pay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements  are funds from outside sources that are used to offset certain position expenses.

Finally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to the 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. The percent change from the prior year is included as a reference point.

Note for Fund Accounts For special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2024 summary is composed of the “Projected Beginning Balance” for January 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and the “Projected Ending Balance” for December 31, 2024. These funds carry over from year to year.

The forecasts are based on economic assumptions, recent collection trends, and current laws and policies. However, actual revenues could vary from forecasts due to unforeseeable economic and technical factors.

2024 Operating Budget Revenue Revenues are divided into tax and non-tax revenues. In 2024, tax revenues are budgeted at approximately $541.8 million and non-tax revenues are budgeted at $172.4 million, comprising approximately 75.9 percent and 24.1 percent of total revenues, respectively. Total revenues are forecast to increase by 2.5 percent in 2024 over the Tax revenues incorporate all major taxes that are levied by the City of Pittsburgh. For each tax, total revenues include current year collections, prior year collections and penalties and interest. Tax revenues are forecast to increase by 1.2 percent in 2024 over the 2023 budget and to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.

Total real estate tax revenues are budgeted at $151.8 million in 2024, an estimated 4.7 percent decrease from the prior year. The real estate tax is the largest source of revenue in the 2024 Operating Budget, comprising approximately 28.0 percent of tax revenues and 21.3 percent of total revenues. Current year real estate tax liability (the amount billed at the beginning of the year) is calculated by applying the millage rate (8.06 mils) to Allegheny County's assessed value of property. On average, residential property comprises approximately 55 percent of the total assessed value of property in the City of Pittsburgh and non-residential property comprises approximately 45 percent. Prior to the county-wide reassessment effective in 2013, the total assessed value of property in the City grew by approximately 1.2 percent on average per year since 2003. The county-wide reassessment led to appeals, most notably for non-residential property, and the total assessed value decreased by 7.8 percent in 2014. Since then, the total assessed value of property has grown by 1.1 percent on average per year, more in line with historical growth.

The largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000 property tax relief (for senior citizens who meet certain requirements), and the 2 percent early-filer discount. Non-profits are exempt from this tax.  Real estate tax incentives for future years are estimated as an average percentage of tax liability based on data since the reassessment. Total real estate tax revenues are forecast to increase by 0.8 percent each year through 2028.

Five-Year Expenditure Forecast The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan submitted by the City highlights the Mayor's commitment to financial sustainability, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, and strengthening financial management practices. The City plans to achieve these by: • Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services • Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations • Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and provide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases • Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and improve the City’s long-term fiscal health by: • Allocating an additional $243 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated minimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC) • Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 10.1 percent of General Fund expenditures in 2024 • Allocating a $22.0 million in "pay-as-you-go" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan In addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key components and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following: • Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase workplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost management initiative.

• Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees, workers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer contributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few years, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Expenditures health and managing costs. Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension funding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.

• Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required costs that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across • Debt Service: The forecast assumes that with the significant reduction in debt service that occurred in 2019, the City will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the City’s critical infrastructure • PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the Capital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the City spends on capital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2024 Capital Improvement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement, economic development, and blight remediation. The forecast assumes that the City will continue to contribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing $22 million in 2024 and a total of $21.1 million from 2025 to 2028.

Most non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout fiscal year 2028. Debt Service will decrease significantly in 2027.

Each Member represents one Council District, and is appointed to be the chairperson of a committee which corresponds to one or more City Departments. Council carries out duties in accordance with the Home Rule Charter and the laws of the state, and is primarily responsible for making laws which govern the City of Pittsburgh. City Council proposes, debates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also approves appointments as provided by the Charter, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final operating and capital budgets for the City.

Since the legislative power of the City is solely vested in the Council, the introduction of legislation necessary for the operations of all City Departments must be introduced by City Council members through their representative committees. Council members also introduce ordinances and resolutions which directly address policy and City Council is entrusted with the review and approval of all City laws. Council members interact with City Departments, other units of government, and the general public as a means to obtain information pertinent to their decision-making process.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget   City Council Districts Fiscal Year 2024  101100 2023 Rate/ Hours/ 2023 2024 Rate/ Hours/ 2024 Title FTE Grade Months Budget FTE Grade Months Budget Member of Council  9  81,137  12 $ 730,233  9  83,571  12 $ 752,139 Council Staff  23 varies  12  1,317,542  28 varies  12  1,619,997 Total Full-Time Permanent Positions  32 $ 2,047,775  37 $ 2,372,136 Temporary, Part-Time, and Seasonal Allowances Administrative/Research  — varies  — $ 257,455  — varies  — $ — Total Full-Time Permanent Positions  32 $ 2,047,775  37 $ 2,372,136 Temporary, Part-Time, and Seasonal Allowances  —  257,455  — Vacancy Allowance  —  —  —  — Total Full-Time Positions and Net Salaries  32 $ 2,305,230  37 $ 2,372,136 The salary of elected city officials is statutorily set by the City's Home Rule Charter, Section 310 (h).

Departmental/Bureau Overview The Commission receives and investigates complaints of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and public accommodations within the jurisdiction of the City. The Commission also provides outreach and education services regarding rights and responsibilities under the Fair Practices Ordinances (PCC: 651-659). These functions are performed within the following program areas: Unlawful Practices Administration and Enforcement - As provided in the City Code, the Commission’s mandate is to receive, investigate, and adjudicate complaints of discriminatory practices in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodations. This office is also charged with the responsibility for the receipt, investigation, and adjudication of complaints alleging civil rights violations by City employees in the exercise of their duties as City employees. The Commission is charged with seeking the satisfactory resolution or adjustment of all complaints through negotiation, mediation, and conciliation.

Inter-Group/Police Community Relations - The Commission studies, investigates, holds public hearings, and conciliates issues in the community that adversely affect inter-group relations, negatively impact the livability of city neighborhoods, and lead to civil unrest.

Education and Outreach  - The Commission provides information on the laws it enforces and its work in the area of community relations through the use of a wide variety of tools including presentations and programs specifically targeted to reach the particular needs of all segments of the population, including the City workforce. These services complement the Commission’s work in the area of enforcement and serve to reduce prejudice, enhance inter-group relations, increase understanding of our need for unity, and bring about a greater level of awareness and compliance with the law.  The Commission also work to further the City’s commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially those focused on peace, justice, and strong institutions.

For the SWAT Team, EMS provides trained Tactical EMS (TEMS) personnel who have undergone all of the required SWAT training in addition to specialized treatment under fire training. They respond as an integral element of the SWAT Team to multiple incidents such as barricaded persons, high risk warrants, and dignitary For the Hazmat Team, EMS participates with the Bureaus of Fire and Police, providing personnel trained and certified to the Technician level for entry, evaluation, mitigation, and decontamination.

The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire encourages all personnel to take a proactive role in reducing the impact from emergencies by providing programs related to fire prevention, public education, community relations, risk reduction, disaster planning, homeland security, and operational training. All services provided to the residents and visitors of the City of Pittsburgh, the County of Allegheny, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be delivered in the most professional manner, to the best of our ability.

Departmental/Bureau Overview The roles and responsibilities of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire as related to public safety include emergency medical care, fire investigation, code enforcement, training, logistics, and suppression. Suppression and emergency medical services are the largest functional area in terms of responsibility and resources. The suppression function is the activity of containing and extinguishing a fire. The goals of the suppression division are to protect lives, property and the environment. The PBF expanded its emergency medical service capabilities by becoming a licensed emergency medical care provider issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The Bureau provides these services through the following four divisions: Administration - Provides managerial and administrative services for the Bureau.  This activity includes budget and finance; payroll; employee relations, strategic planning; record and data gathering, facility and fleet Operations - Provides emergency incident response to protect the lives and property of city residents and visitors. In addition to extinguishing fires, controlling hazardous material emergency incidents, flood response, and emergency management, the personnel in this service area are responsible for providing emergency medical care to sick and injured individuals. The Fire Bureau responds to approximately 20,000 emergency medical calls each Planning and Training - Provides training, communications, and logistics for the Bureau of Fire. The Training Academy implements employee development programs for fire suppression personnel. The programs consist of fire suppression, apparatus driving operations, emergency medical responder, hazardous material, technical rescue, vehicle rescue, and disaster response topics. The PBF expanded its role in disaster preparedness and response, which includes increased capabilities to provide swift-water rescue, as well as taking a proactive role in planning and preparation for a disaster involving crude oil being transported by rail through the City of Pittsburgh, and other transportation emergencies. All new recruits must complete 32 weeks of basic training before being assigned to a permanent station within the PBF. In addition to recruit training, continuing education is required for all members of the PBF. The Bureau also provides public education to various community organizations and City programs such as the Civic Leadership Academy.

Risk Management - Enforces the City’s hazardous material code, the International Fire Code, investigates complaints of life-threatening and unsafe conditions, and conducts fire investigations.

Departmental/Bureau Overview The Office of Community Health and Safety is focused on building a response continuum and developing sustainable upstream interventions to address unmet community social service needs that often fall to Public Safety personnel, who represent the 24/7 safety net response.  Through partnerships and program development, the Office will focus on: Developing a Continuum of Support:  Through continued collaboration with first responders and community members, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and evaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will establish a continuum of resources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public Safety partners.  First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis will be utilized to build this continuum.

Implementation of Public Health-Informed Practices:  Public Safety personnel consistently respond to community needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders have significant exposure to issues that affect community members’ health and well-being.  OCH&S will work with the Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and responses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by community members.  Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate translational experiences.

Consistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and accountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the current response continuum.  OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth.  OCH&S will partner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and may not engage in traditional meetings.  Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism.

Note: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.

Specifically, we strive to: • Create a vibrant community that provides older adults with the social, emotional, and physical resources necessary to be able to stay safe in their home and community.

• Ensure that Pittsburgh’s children & youth have equitable access to quality educational and recreational enrichment opportunities to help them thrive as they enter adulthood.

• Utilize our park assets to offer community wide programs and events that strive to be accessible and welcoming to residents and visitors of all ages.

Departmental/Bureau Overview The Department of Parks and Recreation accomplishes this mission through four core program areas that are supported by an operations and administrative team. The Operations and Administration division has direct oversight over fiscal and HR processes, planning for capital improvement projects, delivery of new programs and initiatives, and the management of all departmental budgets and trust funds. A critical focus of the Operations and Administration division is to coordinate with other City departments, the Office of the Mayor, City Council, and external partners to ensure effective, efficient, and impactful delivery of programs to the public.

Our four core program areas include: Recreation Programs – The Recreation Programs division is committed to providing opportunities for residents and nonresidents of all ages to participate in directed recreational, educational, and enrichment-focused programs and activities. This area includes the operation of our recreation centers and fitness gyms, organized Citisports/ sports programming, activities at the Schenley Ice Rink and Mellon Tennis Center, and the implementation of summer and after-school youth camps and programs. The recreation system has a specific focus on providing services to families and opportunities for Pittsburgh’s youth to have a safe and enriching place during out of Senior and Wellness Programs – Citiparks operates thirteen Healthy Active Living Centers which are focused on improving the physical, intellectual, social, cultural, and financial health and interests of older residents. The senior program partners with other area agencies in delivering quality health and wellness programs, and works to address the needs of individuals as they age. In addition, this division oversees the City of Pittsburgh’s commitment to nutrition support for city residents through the management of food programs for youth and older adults, the City’s Farmers Markets, City Farms, and the newly created Pittsburgh Food Justice Fund.

Community Programs – Community programs and events are focused on activating our park and recreation spaces to engage city residents in a whole host of enriching experiences. Our office of Special Events is charged with hosting movies, music, races, and other key city events including the 4th of July and Light Up Night.  Our Community Enrichment team operates the Roving Art Cart, participates in special recreational programs, partners with PPS Schools, and organizes and plans annual premier celebrations like Alphabet Trail & Tales and Track n' Treat. A  specific focus of this program area is the Rec2Tech initiative. This program focuses on the development and delivery of technology focused programs, coding, and other tech-adjacent learning initiatives.

Aquatics Programs – The aquatics division is responsible for providing city residents with access to safe pools and aquatic activity year-round. The aquatics division operates 18 City of Pittsburgh pools and 9 spray parks during the summer months. In the off season the aquatics team operates the Oliver Bath House, scheduled to complete renovation in fall of 2024, and partners with Pittsburgh Public Schools to host swim opportunities and lifeguard trainings for Pittsburgh youth that may be interesting in becoming a part of the City’s aquatics team. In addition to staffing the pools for open swim, the aquatics team offers learn to swim, water aerobics, and swim team programming throughout the summer months.

The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide independent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  To accomplish this assignment, the Board will thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations; evaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices through public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor and Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.

A Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the staff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.

Departmental/Bureau Overview Investigation and Complaint Disposition  - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the CPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake Coordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of the complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the complaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a preliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides daily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and the results are presented to the Board.  The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an investigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through investigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion.  Findings and recommendations resulting from public hearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board.  Patterns emerging from complaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.

Community Education  - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens and police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and civilian expectations of police conduct.  Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and personal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s role and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the public is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen and the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as offensive.  The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the process, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.

Board and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance, including police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human rights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior.  Staff training is designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops mediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. Staff adheres to the standards and performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.

The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City’s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate, and foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from award through closeout. The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City’s exposure to any grant-related legal liability, and improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.

The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to expand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City’s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant funds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our community. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain technological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed throughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services, recreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows the City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the impact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.

Since its invention in 1904, the Banana Split has become an iconic part of American dessert culture. Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old “soda jerk” at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream – typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry – and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit! The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler’s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as “Dr. Dave’s” among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert. Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry. Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90. In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split, “Ice-Cream Joe” Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler’s invention with the “From Pitt Came the Split” Event. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel’s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record. Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania! David Strickler Inside Strickler’s Drug Store Outside Strickler’s Drug Store Photos courtesy of the Latrobe Historical Society The legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town’s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the “From Pitt Came the Split” event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013. From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration’s honorary chair. We respect your privacy.

There’s no cultural organization in the world quite like Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. With a legacy of discovery and outreach dating back to 1895, today we are a family of four diverse, dynamic museums: Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center, and The Andy Warhol Museum. We’re committed to being inclusive, both on-site and online, and to exploring with our audiences the big ideas and issues of our time. Our mission: To preserve and expand the resources of art and science as agents of personal growth and social advancement in Pittsburgh and beyond. Our Core Values. Our Vision for Impact. Copies of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh’s Federal IRS form 990 and audited financial statements are available upon request. Check out some fascinating highlights from 1895 to today. Each of the four Carnegie Museums has its own distinct personality and incredible experiences to offer. As the largest and most far-reaching cultural organization in the Pittsburgh region, each year Carnegie Museums serves 1.5 million people, including more than 249,000 schoolchildren. Our example as a cultural leader and champion of the Pittsburgh region starts at the top.

> The history of Carnegie Museums is bookended by two periods of fantastic growth and diversification. It all started in November of 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. Andrew Carnegie called the original Oakland building—which included Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh—his “monument,” and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. That’s saying a lot, considering that this son of a poor Scottish weaver grew up to become one of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International, second only to the Venice Biennale as the world’s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum’s collection of art quickly grew as a result. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of “colossal” prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs. The first Carnegie International, 1896 To make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii, Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums’ first major expansion in 1904. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture, perhaps best embodied Andrew Carnegie’s desire to “bring the world” to the people of Pittsburgh. He knew that most of those people would never leave their neighborhoods, their city, let alone the country. So he created a room filled with the casts of some of the greatest architectural wonders of the world. The hall itself is modeled after one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and its rare collection of casts is the largest on display anywhere in the world today. The 1907 expansion Early Dinosaur Hall The Hall of Architecture Adding two new museums Carnegie Museums’ second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries, which gave Carnegie Museum of Art’s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls: Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife. In 1986, the expanding cultural powerhouse became known as “The Carnegie,” and to this day, many in the region still refer to Andrew Carnegie’s Pittsburgh museums as The Carnegie. In 1991, Carnegie Science Center entered the Carnegie Museums fold through a partnership between Carnegie Museums and the Buhl Foundation. Home to Buhl Planetarium, the Miniature Railroad & Village, and hundreds of interactive science exhibits, the Science Center now attracts more than half a million people a year. By the time of its 10-year anniversary in 2001, the Science Center opened Highmark SportsWorks, the largest collection of sports and science exhibits in the world. Carnegie Science Center Three years later, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: The Andy Warhol Museum. In addition to presenting the vast archives of Andy Warhol, the museum also has become a center for dialogue about a diverse range of topics, as well as a global ambassador to Pittsburgh’s cultural richness and diversity through its many traveling exhibitions. The Andy Warhol Museum Today’s ever-changing experiences By the year 2000, the four Carnegie Museums became known as “Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.” The following two decades included the debut of Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s blockbuster Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibit, which is nearly three times the size of the original dinosaur hall and the first exhibit in the world to feature scientifically accurate, immersive environments spanning the Age of Dinosaurs. In 2003 and again in 2012, Carnegie Museum of Art accomplished its most important and most visitor-focused transformations since the opening of the Scaife wing with the reopening of its Scaife Galleries after year-long renovations, which included new presentations of its vast collections and the display of more artwork. In 2014, The Andy Warhol Museum rehung its collection, telling the story of Andy Warhol’s life and artwork chronologically for the first time to spectacular effect. In 2017, Carnegie Museums launched a collaborative event series, Carnegie Nexus, that reaches across the arts and sciences to design experiences that animate pressing issues of our time and instigate new ways to examine our world through live performance, the visual and literary arts, and thoughtful conversation. And in 2018, Carnegie Science Center completed a major expansion: PPG Science Pavilion, which houses a suite of STEM Learning Labs; a Special Exhibitions Gallery for large-scale changing exhibitions; a laser digital giant-screen theater; and outdoor learning spaces on the riverfront.

> Carnegie Museum of Art was the first museum in the United States with a strong focus on contemporary art, instructed by its founder, Andrew Carnegie, to collect the “old masters of tomorrow” at the inception of the Carnegie International in 1896. Today, it’s one of the most dynamic major art institutions in the country. As one of the country’s largest and most respected natural history museums, Carnegie Museum of Natural History plays a critical role in both the Pittsburgh region and the international scientific community by conducting research and presenting exhibitions and programs that highlight the interdependence of humanity and nature, and advocating for the protection of the earth and its inhabitants. The museum’s millions of objects and specimens form one of the world’s great archives of biodiversity and the history of life. Carnegie Science Center, soon to be the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center, is dedicated to inspiring learning and curiosity by connecting science and technology with everyday life. By making science both relevant and fun, the Science Center’s goal is to increase science literacy in the region and motivate young people to seek careers in science and technology. As the region’s most-visited museum, the Science Center reaches 500,000 people annually through hands-on exhibits, camps, classes, and off-site programs. The most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world, The Andy Warhol Museum illuminates the art, life, and times of one of the most influential American artists of the 20th century. Combining artworks, images, and objects from Warhol's colorful life, the museum takes visitors on a tour of Andy Warhol's personal and professional life—from Andy Warhol the Pittsburgh art student to Andy Warhol the Pop icon. With some 500,000 artworks and objects, the museum is the global keeper of Warhol's legacy. ©2025 Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Support

Hope Gillespie There’s a movie poster of Harrison Ford’s iconic character Indiana Jones fixed to Hope Gillespie’s office wall at Carnegie Science Center. It is there for professional inspiration as much as workplace decor. “I cannot overstate the influence Indiana Jones has had on my life,” says Gillespie, who is the museum experiences officer at the Science Center. The film franchise piqued her interest in archaeology—she holds a bachelor’s degree in archaeology from The George Washington University and a master’s degree in the discipline from University College London. But she also just loves the character’s catchphrase about artifacts—“It belongs in a museum”—that informs her work to this day. Since joining the Science Center in 2021, Gillespie has put her archaeology background to use by spending months researching upcoming exhibitions. Her work ranges from studying delicate waterlogged objects in TITANIC: The Artifact Exhibition, the blockbuster exhibition that closed in April, to researching the process of animation for The Science Behind Pixar, which opened May 25. Gillespie trains staff and produces supplementary materials to enhance exhibitions. She also spends a lot of time answering visitors’ questions, which is the part of her job she loves most. “I love teaching,” Gillespie says. “I didn’t think that informal education was my superpower until I started to do it.” Gina Winstead Marcus Harshaw Gretchen Baker Trương Công Tùng, installation view of the state of absence—voices from outside, 2020, in the 58th Carnegie International, Courtesy of the artist and Carnegie Museum of Art.

Many know parts of the story of the 1922 discovery of King Tutankhamun’s tomb in Egypt’s the Valley of the Kings.

Or contact us about your upcoming wedding: Image Gallery Popular wedding spaces include: Oakland Museums Carnegie Science Center The Andy Warhol Museum The reception last week was flawless! It has been a real pleasure to work with you throughout our planning, and your staff was very helpful last week. Everyone was unbelievably pleasant, and our guests were impressed with the venue and the service. It was nice to relax and enjoy the evening knowing that we were in great hands. Adding on the Founders Room at the last minute proved to be a good decision, and I appreciate everyone who also made that a good experience. Thank you again for being such a valuable resource; you really helped us have a positive experience. Adria Banko – 7/16/22 Dear All, We don’t know how to begin to thank you for Colleen & Eric’s Wedding day. Everything and every detail was perfect!! The room looked spectacular and the food was amazing (as well as the amazing wedding cake, which got rave reviews)!! You all did a fantastic job and Trish & I are very grateful! Colleen & Eric could not have been happier the way things turned out and that’s what really matters. Again, Trish and I thank you for everything you did for us and the newlyweds, we really appreciate it!! Kevin & Trish – 6/18/2022 Hello Vanessa, Now that the craziness of our wedding day is over and our emotions have settled, I would like to thank you for your help in making our wedding possible. Your efforts to help get us acclimated to the venue, answer all of our questions, and address all of our concerns over the past year have been exceptional. The venue was absolutely spectacular and directly matched the vision that my wife (still getting used to saying and writing that identifier!) and I sought to witness and present to our guests. Everything from the spacious layout of the tables and chairs to the presentation of the glassware at each table to the depiction of the cookie table was done to perfection! You helped realize our dream, and for that we are incredibly thankful! We would not have known that you were newer to the “Events Manager” role if you had not told us. You did a fabulous job of presenting the information and details to us at the pertinent times and made us feel comfortable throughout the entire process. We cannot keep track of how many people thoroughly enjoyed our wedding, with many of them saying it was the best wedding that they had ever attended! We could not have reaped this praise without your guidance and leadership. Thank you for making the day a memory for life for my wife and me. We still feel beyond excited every time we realize we had our wedding reception at the Science Center! Without you, this would have not been possible! I am currently recommending PointView Hall as a venue to some of my newly engaged friends who are looking to host their wedding. Your name is also being linked to this recommendation, as we feel very confident that you will provide the same quality of service to them as you did to us. I will be sure to contact you in the future should there be another event I would be interested in hosting. Thank you very much! Chandler McGovern-Johnson Wedding – 5/14/2022 Dallas, Thank you so much for all of your hard work in making our wedding day perfect! We so enjoyed working with you and the entire Carnegie museums team for our reception. We absolutely loved how the space turned out and have heard endless compliments on the food. Thank you again for making our day so special. Sydney Dombrowski – 4/23/22 Dallas, Cassie, and Lindsay, Thank you all so much for making our wedding unforgettable. Our guests were blown away by the hospitality, food, and space (hats off to Mr. Carnegie, he had wonderful taste in décor). Our night would not have functioned as well as it did if it weren’t for you ladies and your team. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We truly appreciate everything you did. Much love, The Grubers – 4/23/2022 Good evening! I just wanted to send a big thank you to you and your team at the science center. I got my wedding gallery back today and everything was an absolute dream. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my day so special. All of our guests could not stop raving about the cocktail hour, food, the ballroom, and view. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Jayne and Conner Phillips – 4/2/2022 Dallas, Thank you so much for everything you have done these past few years. You made what could have been a stressful experience moving a wedding four times not very stressful at all. We appreciate you more than you know, and it has been an absolute pleasure working with you. So happy to finally be able to celebrate! Josh and Taylor Davis – 1/16/2022 Bridgitte, Holy crap!!! Thank you so much for everything! Our wedding was absolutely amazing! Everything was perfect! You are such a freaking Rockstar! You have such a wonderful team and we cannot thank you enough. Thank you for being diligent, kind, and prompt. You took wedding planning and it fun and stress free. Thank you so much! We are forever grateful for you, your team and The Warhol Catherine and Jessica – 12/11/2021 A Night to Remember While looking for a venue, my now husband and I wanted somewhere close to downtown with beautiful views, and paired well with our nerdy side. After visiting the Science Center for a tour of the space we knew immediately this was where we wanted our reception to be held. The entire staff and team we coordinated with was so professional, helpful and easy to work with that we fully were able to enjoy the entire evening! The ability to have catering included was a huge bonus for us, as well and not needing to looking into bartenders and other staff. We had such a wonderful night and highly recommend checking out Point View Hall for a larger space! Caitrin F. – 11/13/2021 Dear Dallas, Cassie, & Trista Thank you all so much for helping us organize our wedding on October 23. We felt you all did an exceptional job, we can’t thank you enough for helping to calm our nerves with your excellent attention to detail. If there’s anything we can do in the future (customer reviews, recommendations, etc.) please let us know! All our very best wishes, Sarah and Oliver – 10/23/2021 Dear Dallas, We don’t have the words to thank you enough for all that you did for us. Our wedding was 100% a fairy tale...literally the best night of our lives! You kept us calm during the whole process of planning a pandemic wedding and you’re just so damned nice! The museum is truly lucky to have you and we are so happy we had our wedding there. Trista and Lenny Weiss – 6/26/2021 “Thank you so much for making my daughter’s wedding such a memorable event. It was hard enough to be dealing with Covid-19 without the added stress of a wedding but you were amazing! You went above and beyond the call of duty from zooming the entire event so our friends and family could see it to helping our photographer and working with the music. The Carnegie Museum is such a fabulous place to have a wedding and I think it’s an underused resource in Pittsburgh. Being wed under the T-Rex is just an amazing setting. This was my daughter’s dream wedding for years and you made it possible.” 10/1/2020 What all is included in the rental fee? Tables/chairs, custodial services, limited technical services, entrance security, and someone from the special events office to oversee the event. Things that are prohibited: Sparklers indoors/outdoors, bubbles, dropped/tossed flower petals, confetti indoors/outside, open-flame tapered candles, popcorn, balloons, and open flames. Can anything be hung up? In most cases, we ask that nothing be hung on the walls and signage be free-standing. But that depends on the venue. Just tell us what you have in mind. What time does my event have to end? In most cases, we ask that events end by 1 a.m. Let us know if this is a problem for you event. Do you have a preferred catering list? We partner with our exclusive caterer, Culinaire. Can I bring in cookies for a wedding? Yes! We love the Pittsburgh Cookie Table tradition. Are linens included in fees? Yes, they are included in our wedding package (but not in our other events packages). Can I take pictures in Museum galleries? You can absolutely take photographs in all event spaces. Museum gallery photography varies, however. Just ask us. What about storage for my event? All items that come into the museum must leave the same day. Do you have any preferred vendors? You are welcome to contract the florist and/or entertainment of your choice. We are happy to make recommendations, if needed. How does parking work? Our museums have different parking operations, so please contact your event manager, who will be happy to share venue-specific information. Can you suggest additional museum experiences for my guests? Yes! We can provide docent-led tours of galleries, live demonstrations, and other museum experiences for an additional fee. We look forward to working with you to create the perfect catering package for your wedding day.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Since our founding in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera has enriched the Pittsburgh region by bringing live, world-class opera to our community. We have long been committed to making opera accessible to a diverse audience, but we recognize that a more focused outlook is necessary to ensure that our organization reflects the ideals of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA), in our public offerings as well as internally. Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to fostering a culture of mutual respect - respect for all stories, voices, experiences, and contributions. We aim to reflect this culture both through our leadership structure, programming choices, and employment policies, as well as through our interactions with our audience and the larger community. We recognize and celebrate the rich cultural history of opera while also acknowledging that the classic repertoire is largely European and does not include the perspective or experience of many marginalized communities. Because of this history, it has been especially essential that Pittsburgh Opera recognizes these biases and continues to bring more diverse voices both to our stage and to our staff. For many years, Pittsburgh Opera has provided a platform for contemporary works on the main stage as well as part of our Second Stage Project. Through world premieres such as 2017’s The Summer King, about baseball legend Josh Gibson, and productions of As One and 27, we continue to showcase work by diverse composers and librettists, sung by diverse artists, and supported by a diverse artistic and administrative staff. In addition, Pittsburgh Opera embraces a continued commitment to growth and conversation, as outlined by the following principles: The Summer King: The Josh Gibson Story. 2017.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Pittsburgh Opera enriches Pittsburgh and the tri-state area and draws national and international attention to the region by: The current leader of Pittsburgh Opera is Christopher Hahn, who became Artistic Director in 2000 and General Director in 2008. During his tenure he has considerably expanded the company’s repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Opera’s high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded the Resident Artist Program to include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move to Bitz Opera Factory in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there. Pittsburgh Opera's current Music Director, Antony Walker, was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the company’s musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note. Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here. Founded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburgh’s Tuesday Musical Club (pianist Virginia C. Byerly; contralto Carolyn Hunt Mahaffey; Priscilla W. Collins; Ruby N. Wickersham; and Marie M. Pease), these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States. The first production, in March 1940 at Carnegie Music Hall, was The Tales of Hoffmann, with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. The company’s first conductor, Richard Karp of Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the company’s move to Heinz Hall in 1971. In 1983, Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Opera’s General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera. Mark Weinstein’s appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the company’s growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning. He increased the company’s assets threefold and cemented the Opera’s reputation as a leader in financial management in the region. Weinstein initiated the Artistic Excellence Project, and raised major funds which led to the appointment of Christopher Hahn as Artistic Director in 2000 and John Mauceri as Music Director in 2001. In 2008 Pittsburgh Opera moved to its current and permanent home in the Strip District, finally achieving the space to house the resources needed to better prepare for performances at the Benedum, while opening new ways for the community to experience all the artistry that is part of opera. In an effort to maintain the Company’s mission to enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, the Opera has committed to the use of sustainable methods in the renovation and maintenance of the Bitz Opera Factory, obtaining a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Operations and Maintenance Silver Certification in June 2011. In addition to its mainstage productions, Pittsburgh Opera produces a range of programs to engage and enrich the community, with more than 15,000 students, families and educators participating in its educational events annually. The internationally-renowned Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Program is among the country’s top five training centers for rising opera stars and the newly designed administrative and rehearsal space provides for events ranging from free community Song Shop Concerts to concert recitals by world-class opera singers. Pittsburgh Opera’s long-standing commitment to artistic excellence, responsible fiscal management and good neighborship will continue to prove a valuable asset to the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region for years to come. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Your opera journey begins today! Intimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together!If you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like... Come as you are or glam it up! On weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable! Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman) Tickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn! There are even discounts for groups of 6+, students, 20-Something Tuesdays and more. English texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word! Do you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings? Operas have these in spades! That's why the term "operatic" has come to mean "dramatic to the nth degree." These two will slice your notions of "boring" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman) Operas come in all shapes and sizes! The shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under "Details and Resources." Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way. Just like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too! While almost all operas make use of "classical voice technique," which give operas their signature vocal style, the musical style can vary from Baroque to even Hip Hop! We Shall Not Be Moved lays down fresh beats (Video credit: RLG Creations) Some playful 18th century coluratura from Semele (Video credit: RLG Creations) Some rousing 19th century bravado from Carmen (Video credit: RLG creations) A jazzy number from Charlie Parker's Yardbird (Video credit: RLG Creations) You don’t need to study before you go to the opera any more than you have to study before you go to a movie! Opera is a performing art meant to be enjoyed as is. For people who want to familiarize themselves with the plot in advance, there is a synopsis on the opera’s webpage and program books. And if you want to nerd out you can go to the Pre Opera Talk, Meet The Artists, or pick up a Study Guide at our education table. But you don’t need to do any of those to enjoy the show and understand what’s happening! Not so! There are many comic operas, operas for children, and heartwarming love stories too. While there are operas that will truly break your heart or scare you to your core, opera plays with every human emotion, especially the good ones! Who doesn't love a happy ending?

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Pittsburgh Opera offers an Audio Commentary service for patrons with visual impairments during the Tuesday* performances at all our productions (unless other date is specified). Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as hear descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A patron may reserve a seat in advance by calling , extension 213. An all-volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. An audio describer reads from the program book ten minutes before the performance—the "pre-show"—and then reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage during the performance—the "play-by-play". We're thankful to our volunteers who provide this service each season! Pittsburgh Opera Audio Commentary Team— Julia, Ray, Jan, Donna, and Mary Ann Braille and large-print programs are available at each performance. Infrared hearing devices are available at our Benedum Center performances. Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is for audio amplification. Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Please see our accessibility webpage for details. The Study Guides for each opera are posted in PDF format on the Pittsburgh Opera website in advance of the opera's opening, and are available in paper form at all performances, in the lobby area. For more information about Pittsburgh Opera programs for Adults, please email Marilyn Michalka Egan, Ph.D., Director of Education, or call her at , ext. 242. Pittsburgh Opera provides several courses each season through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.

Connecting the opera to the community, this program provides opportunities for parents and children from select Pittsburgh neighborhoods to attend opera performances together—to experience art as a family. At Pittsburgh Opera, we believe in reaching out to our friends who might not normally be able to attend arts performances, and we believe in preparing them to attend through pre-performance workshops. What better way to experience the magic of opera than to attend with a family member!

Pittsburgh Opera launched our mobile app in 2016, to provide patrons with easy access to information about our productions, artists, and events. The app is powered by Instant Encore, the leading provider of mobile solutions to performing arts organizations around the globe. In the fall of 2018, Instant Encore began offering its customers a premium feature within its platform called Live Note®. Created by the Philadelphia Orchestra in partnership with Drexel University’s Expressive and Creative Interaction Technologies (ExCITe) Center, LiveNote® initially delivered visual content (e.g. text and photographs) to patrons during orchestra performances. Pittsburgh Opera began carefully testing this functionality during our fall 2018 performances of Madama Butterfly and Hansel & Gretel. Pre-selected audience members served as beta testers and provided positive feedback on their experiences. Thanks to an Innovation Grant from OPERA America funded by the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation, Pittsburgh Opera partnered with Instant Encore to add real-time audio capabilities to LiveNote®. We began testing these capabilities in January 2019 at our performances of afterWARds – Mozart’s Idomeneo Reimagined, and continued testing throughout the remainder of our 2018-19 season. Great care had already been taken to ensure the app would not disrupt nearby patrons. After our 2018-19 season ended, Pittsburgh Opera and Instant Encore added additional safeguards to minimize light seepage and reduce the risk of incoming phone calls startling users. With these additional safeguards in place, we publicly rolled out the functionality at the beginning of our 2019-20 season. We will continue to monitor and adjust the app over time. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Music by Giacomo PucciniLibretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa • OCTOBER 18, 21, 24, 26, 2025 When a candle flickers, love sparks.Set against the backdrop of 1830’s Paris, La Bohème follows four impoverished artists surviving with little more than friendship, passion, and their love for art. When Roldolfo, a poet, and Mimì, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death.La Bohème will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music. Emotional and dramatic, it’s no wonder Puccini’s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT. Antony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs.These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.

In their Latin Quarter garret on Christmas Eve, the painter Marcello and poet Rodolfo try to keep warm by burning pages from Rodolfo's latest drama. They are joined by their comrades—Colline, a young philosopher, and Schaunard, a musician who has landed a job and brings food, fuel, and funds (Legna! . . . Sigari!). While they celebrate their unexpected fortune, the landlord, Benoit, arrives to collect the rent. Plying the older man with wine, they urge him to tell of his flirtations, then throw him out in mock indignation. As the friends depart for a celebration at the nearby Café Momus, Rodolfo promises to join them soon, staying behind to finish writing an article. There’s another knock; a neighbor, Mimì, says her candle has gone out on the drafty stairs. Offering her wine when she feels faint, Rodolfo relights her candle and helps her to the door. Mimì realizes she has dropped her key, and as the two search for it, both candles are blown out. In the moonlight the poet takes the girl's shivering hand (Che gelida manina "What a cold little hand") telling her his dreams. She then recounts her solitary life (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì "Yes, they call me Mimì"), embroidering flowers and waiting for spring. Drawn to each other, Mimì and Rodolfo leave for the café (O soave fanciulla "Oh lovely girl"). ACT II. Amid shouts of street hawkers, Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet near the Café Momus and introduces her to his friends. They all sit and order supper. A toy vendor, Parpignol, passes by, besieged by children. Marcello's former lover, Musetta, enters on the arm of the elderly, wealthy Alcindoro. Trying to regain the painter's attention, she sings a waltz about her popularity (Quando me’n vo “When I walk out”). Complaining that her shoe pinches, Musetta sends Alcindoro to fetch a new pair, then falls into Marcello's arms. The Bohemians leave Alcindoro to face the bill when he returns. ACT III. At dawn on the snowy outskirts of Paris, a Customs Officer admits farm women to the city. Musetta and revelers are heard inside a tavern. Soon Mimì walks by, searching for the place where the reunited Marcello and Musetta now live. When the painter emerges, she pours out her distress over Rodolfo's incessant jealousy (Mimì! . . . Speravo di trovarvi qui). It is best they part, she says. Rodolfo, who has been asleep in the tavern, is heard, and Mimì hides; Marcello thinks she has left. The poet tells Marcello he wants to separate from his fickle sweetheart. Pressed further, he breaks down, saying Mimì is dying; her ill health can only worsen in the poverty they share. Overcome, Mimì stumbles forward to bid her lover farewell (Addio . . . D'onde lieta uscì al tuo grido) as Marcello runs back into the tavern to investigate Musetta's raucous laughter. While Mimì and Rodolfo recall their happiness, Musetta quarrels with Marcello (Dunque è proprio finite). The painter and his mistress part in fury, but Mimì and Rodolfo decide to stay together until spring. ACT IV. Some months later, Rodolfo and Marcello lament their loneliness in the garret (O Mimì, tu più non torni). Colline and Schaunard bring a meager meal. The four stage a dance, which turns into a mock fight. The merrymaking is ended when Musetta bursts in, saying Mimì is downstairs, too weak to climb up. As Rodolfo runs to her, Musetta tells how Mimì has begged to be taken to her lover to die. While Mimì is made comfortable, Marcello goes with Musetta to sell her earrings for medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his cherished overcoat (Vecchia zimarra "Old coat"). Alone, Mimì and Rodolfo recall their first days together (Sono andati? "Have they gone?"), but she is seized with coughing. When the others return, Musetta gives Mimì a muff to warm her hands and prays for her life. Mimì dies quietly (Dorme? . . . Riposa), and when Schaunard discovers she is dead, Rodolfo runs to her side, calling her name. -Courtesy of Opera News We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Music by Benjamin BrittenLibretto by William Plomer • JANUARY 24, 27, 30, FEB. 1, 2026 Flow with fate.A woman driven mad by the mystery of her lost son learns of her boy’s unfortunate fate from a chance encounter with a Ferryman while crossing a river.Based on the Japanese Noh play Sumidigawa River, Curlew River retells this story as a Christian parable. Written in the style of monastic plain song and laden with musical symbolism, this piece artfully melds theatrical simplicity with ecumenical grandeur.In keeping with these themes and this opera’s history, Curlew River will be staged at Calvary Episcopal Church in Shadyside. Antony Walker conducts; Dana Kinney directs. Where: Calvary Episcopal Church, Shadyside When: The Ferryman: Erik Nordstrom* The Madwoman: Logan Wagner* The Abbot: Matthew Soibelman* The Traveler: Yazid Gray** Conductor: Antony Walker Stage Director: Dana Kinney* + Pittsburgh Opera debut* Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist** Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Alumnus The scene is set in a church by a Fenland river in early medieval times. A group of monks, acolytes, and lay brethren process in with their Abbot, intoning the plain-chant “Te lucis ante terminum.” The lay brothers go to their instruments and the Abbot announces the performance of a mystery showing how a sign of God’s grace was given. The monks who are to play the Madwoman, the Traveller, and the Ferryman are ceremonially costumed. The Madwoman and the Traveller leave the acting area. The Ferryman, whose duty it is to ferry pilgrims across the Curlew River, steps forward. Today is the day when they come to visit a grave on the other bank which is revered as a shrine. There was a burial there a year ago, and the folk believe it can heal the sick. The Traveller approaches. He has been long on the road and he begs for a place on the ferry, which the Ferryman grants. The Madwoman’s cries are heard in the distance as she sings about curlews, lambs, and crows. When she appears, her confused singing includes the mention of her child, and the pilgrims listen to her in amazement. She tells how her son was seized by a stranger, and how she has lost her mind in despair. She begs to get into the boat, but the Ferryman refuses, alarmed by her strange story. Eventually the Traveller, the Abbot, and the pilgrims persuade the Ferryman to allow her on board, and a sail is hoisted. As the ferry crosses to the other bank, the Ferryman tells how a year before a Heathen man came and left behind a boy who had been ill-treated and was very weak. The boy was able to say he head been stolen from his mother before dying with a prayer on his lips. He was buried nearby. The ferry has reached the bank and the sail is lowered. All go ashore to visit the boy’s tomb except the Madwoman. The Ferryman impatiently tels the Madwoman to be on her way, until her questions reveal that she is his mother and this was the boy she lost. She leads the lamentation, in which all join, her prayers mingling with images of birds and flight. A child’s voice is heard and the Spirit of the Child appears above the tomb. He blesses his mother with the promise that they will meet in Heaven. The Madwoman, the Ferryman, and the Traveller resume their monks’ habits and all recss chanting the “Te lucis.” – Hugh Macdonald, Mark Morris Dance Group We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Music by Giuseppe VerdiLibretto adapted by Arrigo Boito from the play The Merry Wives of Windsor and scenesfrom Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2, by William Shakespeare • APRIL 28, MAY 1, 3, 2026 Laugh last, laugh best. Beloved buffoon Sir John Falstaff has fallen on hard times. But being a ladies’ man (or so he’d like to think), he drunkenly schemes to cash in on his wit and charm by wooing the wealthy wives of Windsor, Alice Ford and Meg Page. However, when these women uncover that he has sent them both identical love letters, they hatch a plan of their own to teach Falstaff a lesson he won’t soon forget! The music matches the merriment and mischief of this madcap romp.

Dr. Caius bursts into Sir John Falstaff’s room in the Garter Inn, accusing him of unseemly behavior the previous night. He further accuses Falstaff’s two henchmen, Bardolph and Pistol, of having robbed him while he was drunk. Unable to obtain reparations, Dr. Caius leaves in a fury. Falstaff contemplates the large bill he has run up at the inn. He informs Bardolph and Pistol that in order to repair his finances he plans to seduce Alice Ford and Meg Page, both wives of prosperous Windsor citizens. When Bardolph and Pistol refuse to deliver the letters Falstaff has written to the two ladies, Falstaff instructs a page to do so instead. He then ridicules Bardolph and Pistol’s newly discovered sense of honor, before throwing them out of his room. The Garter Inn. Alice Ford and Meg Page laugh over the identical love letters they have received from Sir John Falstaff. They share their amusement with Alice’s daughter Nannetta, and with their friend Mistress Quickly. Ford arrives, followed by four men all proffering advice: Dr. Caius, whom Ford favors as Nannetta’s future husband; Bardolph and Pistol, who are now seeking advantageous employment from Ford; and Fenton, who is in love with Ford’s daughter Nannetta. When Ford learns of Falstaff’s plan to seduce his wife, he immediately becomes jealous. While Alice and Meg plan how to take revenge on their importunate suitor, Ford decides to disguise himself in order to pay a visit to Falstaff. Unnoticed in the midst of all the commotion, Nannetta and Fenton manage to steal a few precious moments together. ACT II The Garter Inn. Feigning penitence, Bardolph and Pistol rejoin Falstaff’s service. They show in Mistress Quickly, who informs Falstaff that both Alice and Meg are madly in love with him. She explains that it will be easier to seduce Alice, since her husband is out of the house every afternoon, between two and three. Falstaff joyously anticipates his seduction of Alice. Bardolph now announces that a “Mister Brook” (Ford in disguise) wishes to speak to Falstaff. To Falstaff’s surprise, “Brook” offers him wine and money if he will seduce Alice Ford, explaining that he has long been in love with the lady, but to no avail. If she were to be seduced by the more experienced Falstaff, she might then be more likely to fall a second time and accept “Brook.” Falstaff agrees to the plan, telling his surprised new friend that he already has a rendezvous with Alice that very afternoon. As Falstaff leaves to prepare himself, Ford gives way to jealous rage. When Falstaff returns, dressed in his best clothes, the two men exchange compliments before leaving together. Ford’s house. Mistress Quickly, Alice and Meg are preparing for Falstaff’s visit. Nannetta tearfully tells her mother that her father insists on her marrying Dr. Caius, but Alice tells her daughter not to worry. Falstaff arrives and begins his seduction of Alice, nostalgically boasting of his aristocratic youth as page to the Duke of Norfolk. As Falstaff becomes more amorous, Meg Page interrupts the tête-à-tête, as planned, to announce (in jest) that Ford is approaching. But just at that point Mistress Quickly suddenly returns in a panic to inform Alice that Ford really is on his way, and in a jealous temper. As Ford rushes in with a group of townsfolk, the terrified Falstaff seeks a hiding place, eventually ending up in a large laundry basket. Fenton and Nannetta also hide. Ford and the other men ransack the house. Hearing the sound of kissing, Ford is convinced that he has found his wife and her lover Falstaff together, but is furious to discover Nannetta and Fenton instead. While Ford argues with Fenton, Alice instructs her servants to empty the laundry basket out of the window. To general hilarity, Falstaff is thrown into the River Thames. ACT III Outside the Garter Inn. A wet and bruised Falstaff laments the wickedness of the world, but soon cheers up with a glass of mulled wine. Mistress Quickly persuades him that Alice was innocent of the unfortunate incident at Ford’s house. To prove that Alice still loves him, she proposes a new rendezvous that night in Windsor Great Park. In a letter that Quickly gives to Falstaff, Alice asks the knight to appear at midnight, disguised as the Black Huntsman. Ford, Nannetta, Meg, and Alice prepare the second part of their plot: Nannetta will be Queen of the Fairies and the others, also in disguise, will help to continue Falstaff’s punishment. Ford secretly promises Caius that he will marry Nannetta that evening. Mistress Quickly overhears them. Windsor Great Park. As Fenton and Nannetta are reunited, Alice explains her plan to trick Ford into marrying them. They all hide as Falstaff approaches. On the stroke of midnight, Alice appears. She declares her love for Falstaff, but suddenly runs away, saying that she hears spirits approaching. Nannetta, disguised as the Queen of the Fairies, summons her followers who attack the terrified Falstaff, pinching and poking him until he promises to give up his dissolute ways. In the midst of the assault Falstaff suddenly recognizes Bardolph, and realizes that he has been tricked. While Ford explains that he was “Brook,” Quickly scolds Falstaff for his attempts at seducing two younger, virtuous women. Falstaff accepts that he has been made a figure of fun, but points out that he remains the real source of wit in others. Dr. Caius now comes forward with a figure in white. They are to be married by Ford. Alice brings forward another couple, who also receive Ford’s blessing. When the brides remove their veils it is revealed that Ford has just married Fenton to Nannetta, and Dr. Caius to Bardolph. With everyone now laughing at his expense, Ford has no choice but to forgive the lovers and bless their marriage. Before sitting down to a wedding supper with Sir John Falstaff, the entire company agrees that the whole world may be nothing but a jest filled with jesters, but he who laughs last, laughs best. — Metropolitan Opera We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

At the height of the McCarthy era, naive college graduate Timothy Laughlin comes to Washington eager to join the crusade against communism. But a chance encounter with a handsome State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job—and his first relationship with a man. Under the threat of increased government scrutiny, this complicated and clandestine affair will put both men’s loyalties and convictions to the ultimate test. As the poisonous political climate pollutes their relationship, love becomes a casualty of what it takes to “play the game” in Washington. Based on Thomas Mallon’s 2007 gut-wrenching novel, Fellow Travelers was praised as “a near-perfect example of fast-flowing musical drama” by The New York Times and is already widely considered a contemporary classic.

Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife. Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet. Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again. Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die. A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night. Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him. Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Music by Jennifer HigdonLibretto by Jerre Dye • APRIL 26, 29, MAY 2, 3, 4, 2025 A family portraitWhen Mona finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen masterpieces, she must grapple with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son—the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon (Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!Commissioned by Opera Philadelphia.

The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona. In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life. The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly. Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future. With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings while simultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go. - courtesy of the creators We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

Today, Forever, our 80th Anniversary Campaign, honors their foresight and legacy as we prepare for our next 80 years. Pittsburgh Opera has a significant record of excellence, authenticity, and passion. The superb quality of our on-stage productions, Resident Artists program, and community engagement initiatives is recognized internationally. We are among the very few opera companies that owns our facilities for rehearsal, costumes, and administration. Our building was built in 1869 as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory, which perfectly illustrates Pittsburgh Opera’s deep and resonant connection to our region and our past. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Pittsburgh Opera strives for accessibility in its performances, performance spaces, communications, and at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. We have also been a leader in offering accessibility services, such as Audio Commentary and Braille program books, at performances. Pittsburgh Opera is committed to including all staff, patrons, and volunteers in all performances and programs. We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions. We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers. We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company. All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage (unless otherwise noted). These are sometimes referred to as "OpTrans". Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory. Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the "pre-show". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the "play-by-play". Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling , ext. 213. Tickets are $14.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby. Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) transmit and/or amplify the sound of a production for anyone with or without a hearing aid. The Benedum Center has two systems for Assistive Listening: an Infrared system and an Inductive Loop system. Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory have radio systems for broadcasting audio description. These Assistive Listening Devices with radio receivers are set to the frequency of the broadcast. After patrons turn the radio on, they can adjust the volume. Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Requests for sign language interpreters must be received at least two weeks prior to the performance, and are subject to the availability of an interpreter. To request an ASL interpreter at a Pittsburgh Opera performance, please email us or call x216 for details. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call the Benedum Center directly at . Watch the video below to learn how ASL interpreters enhance the performance for patrons, and why ASL conveys things beyond what our supertitles can do. Video by Abbie Whitehurst Large print and Braille programs are available for every performance and may be obtained in the Guest Services Center at the Benedum Center. For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and at the Bitz Opera Factory, Braille and Large Print programs may be obtained at the Education table in the lobby. Patrons who wish to read study guides in advance of performances may request that their email addresses be added to the Audio Commentary email updates list. Sensory Workshops are held for select productions at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. These workshops examine the story, the music, and the background of the opera. Participants will have a chance to explore the scenery, props, and costumes. Workshops are conducted by the Education Department. Sensory Workshops are free, but reservations should be made by calling , ext. 242. Customers with physical disabilities requiring an extra chair or a wheelchair location will be seated in an aisle space in the George R. White Studio. Since the George R.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room, which will be used exclusively for this service. There are a limited number of spaces available, and pre-registration is required. To register, you (the parent/guardian of the child) will ‘purchase’ a free childcare ticket when you buy your own ticket to the opera. Your order confirmation email will include a link to a registration form, which includes your seating location, information about any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and you must remain in the building during the performance. The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Pittsburgh Opera has worked closely with their partners at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which owns and operates the Benedum Center, and Priya Amin, the founder of on-site childcare provider Flexable, to bring this program to life. Where is the childcare provided? The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room on the second floor, which will be used exclusively for this service. What are the age limits? The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service.

Please use the process shown in the "How to add Childcare to your ticket purchase" section below to add Childcare tickets to your shopping cart while you are purchasing your tickets to see the opera performance. You will receive a 'ticket' for the childcare which the usher will scan when you enter the Benedum just like they'll scan your ticket to the performance. Once I order my childcare ticket, am I done? Not quite. Your order confirmation email will include a link to an online registration form to fill out. This form will ask for information about things such as your seating location, the child's name and age, any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You will need to fill out and submit that form in advance. The form includes a liability waiver, which you can read in the "Liability Waiver" section of this webpage. The parent/guardian must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and remain in the building during the performance. When do I drop off and pick up my child? The Benedum Center opens 1 hour 15 minutes before the performance starts. You may drop your child off anytime after the Benedum opens up until the beginning of the performance. You are welcome to visit your child during intermission if you wish. Children must be picked up within 10 minutes of the performance’s ending. Children may only be released to the person that signed them in to the childcare area. NO EXCEPTIONS. After I drop my kid off, can I duck across the street for a bite to eat before the show starts? No! In fact, double No. The parent/guardian must remain in the building during the performance. Can I bring toys or books or games, or their favorite stuffed animal, for my child to use? Yes, provided you adhere to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Bag Policy and their Prohibited Items policy. Pittsburgh Opera will have a range of age-appropriate activities available for your child to use. Will there be food provided? Parents may feed their children snacks, e.g. during intermission, but the childcare providers will not provide food to the children. Please note that parents must follow the Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts' outside food and beverage policy. What about bathrooms and dirty diapers? Childcare staff will cover diaper changes and/or accompany kids to the bathroom unless the parent requests otherwise. Parents must bring their child's diapers/wipes/pullups. My child takes medication every afternoon. Will you give my child their regular daily medication? No, medications will not be administered by childcare staff.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 The rideshare program will let Pittsburgh Opera ticket buyers for Armida and/or Madama Butterfly add $60 of Uber Vouchers to their Pittsburgh Opera ticket purchase, at no extra cost. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers. The vouchers can be used on the opera’s performance date, for rides that start or end within a half-mile radius of the theater. 1. After selecting the Pittsburgh Opera performance you’d like to see on our online ticketing website opera.culturaldistrict.org and adding it to your cart, click on the “Rideshare Voucher Program” link in the “Add Rideshare” box: (See screenshot examples from last year's inaugural rideshare program at La Traviata below:) 2. Click on the “Get Tickets” link on the Rideshare Voucher Program page: 3. Select the date of your performance – please be sure it matches the performance you are purchasing tickets for: 4. Select “1” from the “How Many Tickets” drop-down menu: You will then see the Rideshare Voucher added to your cart, along with your ticket to the performance. You can then check Check Out as usual. Please note that for the vouchers to work correctly, either your email address or phone number in your CulturalDistrict.org account must match the email address or phone number you use in your Uber account. Uber will ‘match’ you by comparing the email addresses and phone numbers in our recipient lists with their own account records. At least 72 hours prior to your performance, Pittsburgh Opera will add you to our voucher recipient list in our Uber for Business account. You will receive an email from Uber notifying you about the Voucher, which may look like this: Once you accept the voucher through Uber’s direct invitation, the voucher will be added to your Uber account. Then the voucher will automatically be applied to rides that match the voucher criteria. If you spend more than the voucher covers, Uber will charge any overage to your personal payment method. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages, and recipients should make sure that the voucher has started, isn’t expired, and is valid for the time and location. Recipients can always reach out to Uber through in-app support, and a specialized team will help them. Please note that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown below, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. If Uber does charge you anyway, please contact us and we will happily resolve it for you. When can I use the voucher? The voucher will come with specific date and time information; it can only be used during that date and time. The date will be the date of your Pittsburgh Opera performance. Pittsburgh Opera builds in a cushion of several hours before and after the show when the voucher can be used, so that if you want to go to dinner downtown before the show or do something else nearby afterwards, you can. Do I have to be dropped off or picked up at the actual theater? Nope. Your ride must either originate from or finish within a half-mile radius of the theater. If you want to be dropped off at a nearby restaurant, or picked up from a watering hole around the corner a few hours after the show, that’s fine. What if my rides end up costing more than $60? You will be responsible for paying any amounts above $60; Uber will charge your payment method already on file. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages. What if my rides end up costing less than $60, can I keep the leftover credit? Sorry, no. The credits can only be used for rides to/from your opera performance. If your ride is less than $60, we recommend you be happy that your whole ride was free. Will Pittsburgh Opera schedule my ride for me? No. Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. We are merely providing funds for you to use. I'm not sure how to use Uber. Should I call Pittsburgh Opera? No. The good people at Uber know much more about setting up and using Uber accounts than we do. We recommend you explore their Support Resources for Uber Riders webpage, or ask your friends or relatives who use Uber. Can I use Lyft instead of Uber? Currently Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program exclusively uses Uber. Can I use some of my voucher for Uber Eats? Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program is specifically for rides, not food. I already bought a ticket to the opera – can I add an Uber Voucher now? Rideshare vouchers can only be added to new ticket purchases; the offer is not valid on past ticket purchases. What if I don’t receive my voucher? Please double check that the phone number and email address in your Uber account match the ones in your CulturalDistrict.org account. Please email us within 48 hours of your performance with your name, contact information, and order number and we can verify if you were added as a voucher recipient. I got my voucher, and even though I scheduled my ride to the theater within the specified timeframe, Uber looks like they're making me pay for my ride with my credit/debit card. What's the deal? As we were testing the voucher program, we noticed that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown here, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. Pittsburgh Opera is not responsible for any ride-related issues, e.g. the driver failing to arrive on time; the car gets a flat tire, you’re stuck in traffic and miss the beginning of the performance, etc. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Rideshare vouchers can be added to new ticket purchases only; offer not valid on past ticket purchases. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under "Details and Resources." Typically first-timers like to start with classics like Madama Butterfly (coming March, 2024) at the Benedum Center. They've got famous and familiar music, fantastic casts, traditional sets and costumes, and, well, that grand-opera grandness that so many people love. You'll understand every word with the English texts projected above the stage. Of course! Opera is fun for the whole family. We have kids who come to our student matinees and then make their parents come back so they can see the show again. The main thing is that your child should be able to sit quietly for long periods of time. Third or fourth graders are usually fine, but parents are the best judge. Pittsburgh Opera sells tickets for kids and teens ages 6-18 for half-price, to make it easier for you to expose them to this wonderful art form. Some operas – OK, most operas – have adult themes. Murder, revenge, lust – all that stuff that grown-ups find so interesting. Kids do best if you prepare them in advance. Tell them the story of the opera, play some of the music, or watch a few videos on YouTube. Have your little Warhols and Cassatts draw pictures of their favorite characters or imagine what the set might be like. Be creative! A little common courtesy is all you need. It probably bothers you when people talk and rattle their candy wrappers at the movies, or talk on their phones, or show up late, or get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the show. If something is considered poor form at the movies, it's probably poor form at the opera too. If you’re not sure when to clap, just wait until everybody else does. If you really like what you hear, yell, “Bravo!” Or just cheer! Yes! Our mainstage productions are at the Benedum Center. Our 2023-24 season features The Barber of Seville, The Flying Dutchman, and La Traviata at the Benedum Center live and large on the grand stage. Parking near the Benedum CenterThe are several parking garages within a few blocks of the Benedum Center. You can get real-time parking availability at ParkPGH.

Try the free Pre-Opera Talks with Kristin Gatch one hour before every curtain at Benedum Center and CAPA Theater performances.

If you have redeemed your Pass for tickets whose normal face values totals more than you've paid so far for your Pass, then Pittsburgh Opera reserves the right to charge you for the difference. For example, if you buy a Pass, immediately redeem it for a ticket, and then after the performance you cancel your Pass, we will charge you the difference between the regular ticket price and the $20 you paid for your Pass. The Opus Pass is a great value, we just want to make sure folks don't try to game the system - not that you would ever do that of course!

If you need an accessible seat, e.g. for a wheelchair, please let us know. Pittsburgh Opera will do our best to honor specific seating requests. But please know that specific seat assignments are not guaranteed, and are subject to availability. Where do I pick up my tickets? At Will Call. Please remember to bring photo ID. What if a performance is already sold out? If a performance is already sold out when a Passholder tries to redeem their Pass for a ticket, they will have the option of being placed on the Wait List, and will be eligible to use tickets released by other patrons. What if I end up not being able to attend a performance I redeemed my Pass for? We understand that unexpected circumstances may prevent you from attending a performance which you've redeemed your Pass for. If that happens, please let us know at least one hour prior to the performance so that we can release your ticket. Passholders who repeatedly request tickets and do not use them without notifying us in advance may have their Pass revoked at the discretion of Pittsburgh Opera. Can I give my Opus Pass to someone else when I'm not using it? No. Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are non-transferable. You must show Photo ID when picking up your tickets. I normally buy two tickets to the opera - one for me and one for my partner or friend. Do we each need our own Opus Pass if we want to go to the same performances together? It depends. I want to buy two Opus Passes and bring a different friend to each performance. Can I? No. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. However, Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any given performance at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. Can I buy extra tickets when I redeem my Pass for a performance? Yes! Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any performance, subject to availability, at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price. Your seats will be together. I’d like to order an Opus Pass for a friend as a gift. Can I? Yes! Please call us at ext. 3 and we will be happy to help you. Can I order a bunch of tickets with my Opus Pass and then turn around and sell them? No! Tickets reserved through the Opus Pass are intended for use by the Passholder, and may not be resold. Passholders found to have violated this policy are subject to having their Passes revoked without refund. Is my Opus Pass good for Pittsburgh Opera's galas or other paid events? Your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass is good for all our staged operas. It does not include admission to our galas (the Diamond Horseshoe Ball and Maecenas) or paid special events such as our annual Fashion Show - tickets for those must be purchased separately. I am a Pittsburgh Opera subscriber who wants to keep my seats. Can I get an Opus Pass? Yes! You can get our Opus Pass Subscription Add On for just an extra $5 a month. rs who elect the Add On will keep their existing seats for their primary performance, but aren’t guaranteed those same seats for the performances seen with their Opus Pass. The Opus Pass Subscription Add On is a great way to see your favorites more than once and to check out different locations in the theater for a very low price. Can I get the Opus Pass Subscription Add On if I modify my subscription? If you maintain your 2023-24 subscription package for 2024-25, or if you add an extra opera to your package or upgrade your seating zone, you can add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. But if you 'downgrade', for example go from a 2023-24 Quartet to a 2024-25 Duet package, you cannot add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. Do I pay for my Opus Pass Add On upfront, or am I billed monthly? rs who select a Opus Pass Add On will have the $60 annual cost for their Pass added to their order total, which can be paid all at once or in installments. Can I still get an Opus Pass Add On if I subscribe after the 2024-25 season is underway? Yes. Your Opus Pass Add On would be valid for the remainder of the 2024-25 season. We would charge you $5/month for the remaining months of the season, i.e. a pro-rated portion of the $60 annual cost. If I have to cancel my Subscription, what happens to my Opus Pass Add On? If a subscriber cancels their subscription, their Opus Pass Add On will be canceled too. They will be eligible to purchase a Opus Pass at the regular price of $20/month. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

Pittsburgh Opera's official online ticketing site homepage is opera.culturaldistrict.org, which we operate in partnership with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's online ticketing site trustarts.org.

Pittsburgh Opera cannot give you a refund if you have to cancel, since you did not buy the ticket from us. Pittsburgh Opera cannot contact you with crucial information on show cancellations, time changes, road closures or traffic updates, upcoming shows or other useful information. Tickets purchased from unofficial sources are done so at a risk. By purchasing only from opera.culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org you are assured that the ticket you receive is valid and is being sold to you at current face value.

Pittsburgh Restaurant Week is a celebration of restaurants and dining in the steel city. Started in 2012, it’s been an annual tradition to host a winter edition in January and summer edition in August. The winter edition focuses of celebrating “New Dishes for the New Year” while the summer edition features dishes taking advantage of the local produce and harvests with lighter fare. In order to participate in restaurant week, the restaurant is expected to create a limited-time small menu that is offered for dine-in guests during the dinner meals between the dates of the celebration alongside the restaurant’s normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement. See more details on pricing below. Restaurant registration is accepted on a rolling basis up until the celebration. A restaurant must complete the online registration form and submit timely payment to appear on the listing of restaurants and on the participating restaurant map. The registration form will ask for the anticipated pricing structure (multi-course vs special entrees, but the exact pricing structure is NOT locked in until menu is provided. On the restaurant listing page, the restaurant appears at the bottom of the page until the menu is received. Once the limited-time menu has been determined, upload the special menu through the website to receive the full benefit of the celebration. It is recommended the menu is provided as text-only and not embedded in a prepared graphic. Once the menu is provided, it will be posted to the restaurant’s profile. Menus submitted before the posted deadline will be formatted and shared through Pittsburgh Restaurant Week’s social media platforms. Menus provided after the deadline will be posted to the website but will forfeit the benefit of the social media versions being created. With such a wide variety of establishments participating, a one-size-fits all pricing model doesn’t make sense, so Pittsburgh Restaurant Week has themed pricing of “24-cents” for 2024. All special menus should follow that pricing model. Common pricing options include: Restaurant Owners: Sign-up to receive exclusive restaurant owner alerts:

This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs. The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania. In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years. Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections. The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today. Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District. With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions. Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, : A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage. As Pittsburgh’s “people museum,” the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the world’s oldest jeep. The Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located on the History Center’s second and third floors, celebrates the unsurpassed sports legacy of the City of Champions. From football to baseball and hockey to golf, the Sports Museum highlights the region’s passion for amateur and professional sports. The Fort Pitt Museum, located in historic Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, is a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot museum that presents the story of Western Pennsylvania’s essential role during the French & Indian War, the American Revolution, and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh. Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America, is located in Avella, Washington County, Pa. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a National Historic Landmark, features 19,000-year-old evidence of the region’s earliest inhabitants under a massive rock overhang. In addition to the Rockshelter, the site is also home to three outdoor historic areas, including a 16th century Indian village, 18th century Frontier Trading Post, and 19th century village that help visitors experience life over the past 500 years. More than 250 years of our region’s history can be found at the Thomas and Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Founded in 1879, the Library & Archives’ collections are accessible to researchers, students, and the general public. The History Center recently earned the coveted 4-star rating from Charity Navigator for sound fiscal management and commitment to accountability and transparency, so you can be confident that your donation is going to a great place. © 2025 Heinz History Center

Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History Model of the Rodman Process pioneered at the Fort Pitt Foundry, c. 1864 (base added in 1878) The first gun built using the Rodman hollow casting process was made at the Fort Pitt Foundry in the 1850s. In 1860, the War Department commissioned Rodman to build the world’s first 15-inch cannon. By 1864, Rodman had also supervised the fabrication of a massive 20-inch gun. This model depicts the specialized intricate casting apparatus used in making the first 20-inch Rodman, which required nearly 80 tons of molten iron poured from three furnaces. A complex four-piece mold was required to shape the cannon, which was cast in an upright position. The completed 20-inch gun barrel, one of six made at the Fort Pitt Foundry, weighed 117,000 pounds. This model educated West Point Military Academy cadets on the casting techniques pioneered in Pittsburgh. Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History KDKA transmitter, c. 1921 In the days when there were few regulations for radios, Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer, built a makeshift studio in his garage and played records over the airwaves. His supervisor at Westinghouse, Harry P. Davis saw Conrad’s hobby as a great way to sell more radios, and they applied for the first commercial radio license. On October 27, 1920, they received the call letters KDKA and set up a small studio in Westinghouse’s East Pittsburgh Works. On November 2, KDKA broadcast the election results between Harding and Cox, credited as the first commercial radio broadcast.

The Heinz History Center actively seeks collections and archival materials related to the history of Western Pennsylvania and the experiences of its people, both past and present. If you have objects, photographs, artwork, digital material, or documents that you believe would be of potential interest to our collection, we would like to hear from you. To start the donation process, please tell us about your materials by filling out an Collection Donation Form. The more information provided about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania, the easier it is for our Collections Committee to assess. An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is also appreciated. Donate to the Collection For additional questions or information, please email [email protected]. Please use on our online form to offer historic materials. Please do not bring materials to the History Center without an appointment. Tell us anything you know about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania. For example, you might explain who owned them and when or how they were used or why they were produced. An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is appreciated. The material will then be assessed by our Collections Committee and you will be notified of their decision. Materials that document the lives of Western Pennsylvanians and the history of the region up to and including the present. Historic materials can take many forms, such as personal letters, business records, uniforms, tools, local souvenirs, paintings of Western Pennsylvania, published books or family scrapbooks, hand-made quilts, and Pittsburgh manufactured products. The most important criterion for donation is that the materials say something about this region. It is important to provide as much detail as you can about the articles you wish to donate, this will help the Collections Committee make a more informed decision. We cannot accept everything. Organizing, cataloging, and preserving historical materials for the future takes so much space, time, and money, that donations must be selected very carefully. Staff review each offer and compare it with what we already have in the collection, they assess its condition and determine what it tells us about life in Western Pennsylvania. Normally, objects and artwork need to be seen before a decision can be made. Unless we designate your materials for a specific exhibit, they will not be put on display immediately. What you see at the History Center is only a very small part of the collections. That is because we have limited gallery space and because long-term display can have negative effects on preservation. The rest are carefully catalogued and stored in a temperature controlled environment so that they will be available for future exhibits at the History Center, for loan to other museums, or for research and reference for generations to come. Please do nothing to the items. We prefer to see them in their original condition. Do not clean, repaint, refinish, or “spruce up” historical materials before giving them to us. Please provide as much related historical information as possible. For example, if you plan to offer your grandfather’s report card, you might also offer photographs of him as a student, samples of his school papers and the cap he wore at school. If you have photographs it is helpful to make copies and identify the people and locations in the images. Documents, photographs and published materials are available for research and reference in the Detre Library & Archives at the History Center during regular hours. Requests to see artwork and objects should be made to the collections manager at . Please give our curators and archivists at least two weeks advance notice. Yes. The donor is responsible for determining and documenting the value of a donation. Staff at the History Center cannot appraise materials. They can give you a list of certified appraisers. Materials are not accepted on long term loan, nor can agreements be made to return materials to heirs. Occasionally, short term loans for specific exhibits are accepted. The Deed of Gift, signed by every donor, gives the History Center clear ownership of the materials. The History Center accepts responsibility for preserving each donation for generations to come. Yes. Please contact us and let us know of the planned bequest. We appreciate having the opportunity to learn the story behind the materials. We can also explain in further detail the appropriate phrasing for your documents. Please note, bequests must meet collections requirements. Each item or collection is different, but factors that contribute to the decision include, but are not limited to, its historical or cultural significance to the Western Pennsylvania region, physical condition, whether or not the museum already owns a similar item or copy, and its ownership history. With limited space and resources, our interest is in building the collection where gaps exist or in area of particular interest. In general, we are not interested in adding items that duplicate those already in the collection. You can search the Library & Archives holdings here. Each item or collection that is donated is assigned a unique number and entered into the online catalog. Depending on the size of a collection, more work might need to be done prior to it being accessible to the public. This includes, but limited to, organizing, re-housing materials in acid-free folders, addressing minor preservation needs, and writing a finding aid to the collection. Very rarely does the Detre Library & Archives purchase a collection. On these occasions, we cannot suggest or set a purchase price. This must be set by the seller. For assistance in identifying historical materials or learning more about them, please email [email protected]. While we do not provide appraisals, our team can suggest ways to locate certified appraisers. © 2025 Heinz History Center

You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world’s leading conductors, whose distinctive and revelatory interpretations receive great international acclaim. As Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the 2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival, Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour, starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus. Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY® nominations, and he and the orchestra won the GRAMMY® for "Best Orchestral Performance" in 2018. The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical acclaim. Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, following decades of close collaboration. Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss, Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, leading a revival of Mozart’s Idomeneo. Beyond the podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites, including Janáček’s Jenůfa, Strauss’s Elektra, Dvořák’s Rusalka as well as Puccini's Turandot which he regularly performs around the globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’s Salome, was premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023. As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty years. In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on the music of this composer. Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International Classical Music Awards declared him "Artist of the Year". Please do not shorten or revise without permission of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

Entrance Security Policy All audience members are required to enter through state-of-the-art scanning equipment, designed both to enhance security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There will be no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Bag and Personal Belongings Policy Heinz Hall reserves the right to search any bags entering the facility. Oversized bags must fit comfortably under a seat to ensure the safety of patrons entering or exiting seats and aisles. Bags failing to meet these requirements must be checked at which time a search will be conducted by security or returned to your vehicle. You are encouraged to leave personal computers and iPads at home, as they are required to be turned off during performances. Costume Policy Heinz Hall does not permit masks of any kind or facsimiles of weapons that would make other guests feel uncomfortable or detract from the concert experience. Guests are welcome to attend certain programs (such as, The Music of Harry Potter or The Music of Star Wars) in costume. What exactly is the Heinz Hall “free-flow” screening system? In use at hundreds of sites worldwide including Lincoln Center, Oakland (CA) Airport and LL Bean, the Heinz Hall screening system uses “smart” technology to enhance visitor security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There is no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What if I don't want to go through the scanner? An alternative entry door will be available that will have wanding and bag check. Is the scanner safe for medical devices and pregnant women? The system is safe to go through with medical devices and for pregnant women. However, on request, you may use the alternative entry door that will have wanding and bag check. Is screening the the same at every concert or event? As is the case now, artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What makes the system "smart" and what will you do with the video images? The screening equipment uses technology to screen for threats. The images captured by the system for alarm purposes are only captured briefly; they are not retained by Heinz Hall. There is no official dress code for events in Heinz Hall. Many patrons wear business attire, and many prefer to be more casual. Wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable.

Inspired by Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated), KEA — an acclaimed artist celebrated for her soulful voice, evocative storytelling, and magnetic stage presence — weaves together music, poetry, and visual elements to reflect on the legacy of racial history in America. Joined by her talented duo of musicians on drums and guitar, the program features iconic African-American songs, original verse, and rhythmic percussion, bridging past and present in a profound meditation on resilience, heritage, and justice. Ticket price includes exhibition admission, a glass of wine (21+), and after the performance meet-and-greet with the musicians. Advance registration and pre-payment required. KEA — vocals Gary Kalinoski — guitar Kai Ballard — percussion Raised in Pittsburgh to a singer/guitarist father and a violinist mother, KEA has had an intimate relationship with music all her life. With her love for literature, her first writings were in the realm of poetry. KEA's love for singing blossomed following vocal training from Elayne Kitay and the local Jazz Workshop. KEA was always sensitive and deeply affected by the ebb and flow of personal relationships — the sweet beginnings, the steamy evolutions, the work put in to sustain them, and all too often, the endings. Her insights became poems and later songs, each helping her shape her unique outlet of soul with a touch of jazz. A debut single, "iLove You," came to her one inspirational night in 2015 when she sat down to write a poem-like lullaby for one of her daughters. She later turned that poem into a song about an older daughter battling kidney hydro-nephrosis since birth. When the opportunity presented itself, KEA recorded "iLove You" and independently released it to the world on July 28, 2017, where it garnered profound international support on the BBC and Radiovolna and peaked at on four U.K. Soul charts. smoothjazz.com even chose it as 'Song of the Month' by influential music site SoulTracks. To keep up the momentum, KEA had a beautiful video shot in high definition 4K. From the pages of her life struggles, the storyline was the years that KEA placed romance on the backburner to focus on her daughter's health. The “iLove You” video was directed and edited by Deon Smalley (Smalley Films), and KEA, who also cast the clip and handled the production and costume design. It was vital to KEA for the key locations around Pittsburgh to serve as backdrops, in-cluding Andrew Carnegie Free Library and Music Hall, Airbnb Historic Day House, and Dorsey’s Records shop. Most poignantly, the video starred KEA and her children Au-hneyah (6) and Alyssa (16) (playing one child over ten years), solidifying the intimate single-parent family portrait of unshakable love between a mother and daughter. KEA returned with her second single. “Not My Friend,” a smooth, engaging groove with a pretty melody about a woman disconnecting from an unhealthy relationship. This song addressed a man who was verbally and emotionally abusive, controlling, non-communicative and self-centered. As a holiday treat for her increasing number of fans, KEA showcased her unique interpretive skills with a haunting rendition of Motown legend William “Smokey” Robinson’s winter of 1980 classic, “Being with You.” Where Robinson's rendition took a deceptively breezy musical approach about a man desper-ate to keep a lover, KEA dug into the darker psychological impact of the words. KEA’s version of "Being with You" is known on the charts of America and the U.K. and she has achieved success on Digital Radio Tracker, Top 30 on the Urban Influencer urban chart, coveted streams on I-Heart radio, and supportive U.S. stations such as WFSK in Nashville, KCCB in Corning, Arkansas, and Top 10 status at Buffalo, New York's WUFO. Promising more provocative songs with intriguing titles such as “Black Man,” “Black Beauty”, and “Pieces of a Man,” KEA’s goals are for mainstream and international suc-cess. She has performed at hometown Pittsburgh events and venues such as the Channel 11 News Holiday Parade, Stars at Riverview Jazz Series, The Birthright of Pittsburgh, the Explore East Liberty 2018 Wine Festival, the Harambe Black Arts Festi-val, the Christine Fréchard Gallery, and the Carnegie Arts Initiative (Jazz On 3rd). The Black Lives Matter movement inspired "Holla if You Hear Me” and it quickly be-came one of Amazon’s hottest new releases. KEA also achieved success on the UK Soul chart and the ‘National Indie Soul Chart’ platforms ranking in the top . She was even invited to perform for their BMMAC (Black Music Month Award Ceremony in Buffalo, New York. During the ceremony, she met Gary Hines, Music Director and Pro-ducer of the 3-time Grammy Award-Winning Sounds of Blackness. In the words of Gary Hines, he said about her performance, "She killed tonight; she is amazing." He told KEA, "You are a phenomenal woman." Her success continued with “We made it thru” and “Turn it Around” — two releases that continued to show her ever-expanded range of lyric skills and ability to get to the heart of issues that really matter. But there is more to KEA than writing and recording. She is an artist who knows what it means to connect in-person with real people. Always close to her community, she has been something of a staple in Pittsburgh's en-tertainment scene. The Downtown Pittsburgh Partnership and Walnut Capital and opening the Picklesburgh three-day festival held at the iconic Andy Warhol Bridge are all on her list of achievements. She even performed at “The Biggest Party of the Year”, Pittsburgh's Light Up Night festival. KEA has been booked throughout the year and is always excited to connect with a new crowd with lyrics and sounds that are always raw, real, and straight from the heart. Kai is a trained drummer who mastered his craft while studying at Florissant Valley Community College followed by a stint at Indiana University School of Music, Bloomington, IN. It was at I.U. where his passion fully took hold and he played in a plethora of bands, operas, symphonies and musicals. Notable productions include Barber of Seville, Cabaret, Working, Meet Me In St. Louis and Phantom of the Opera. He has also toured with Krystol who had a top ten billboard hit with “Passion for a Woman” writ-ten by Randy Jackson and opened for Morris Day, ConFunkShun and the Jetts. A year later and he toured with Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, followed by performances with Miki Howard and Jean Carne across a range of LA venues. A notable career highlight was having the opportunity to rehearse with Stevie Wonder for sev-eral months in his Wonderland studio. Big things continued when Kai toured with L.L. Cool J on the Budweiser Tour alongside Whitney Houston, Keith Sweat, Digital Underground and many more. This was all before his passion for music took him to Japan with members of Earth, Wind & Fire, as well as several other groups of that era. Jump forward to 1994 and you may remember seeing him perform on Saturday Night Live with the one and only Snoop Doggy Dogg. Hot off the back of that he received a full cymbal, stick and merchandise endorsement from Zildjian and continued to do his thing like no one else. Along the way he took instruction at UCLA where Randy Jackson (then A&R VP at A&M Rec-ords) and Barry Squire (then A&R manager at Columbia Records) taught him like only they can. He soon headed over to Capitol Records where he would work on the iconic Paul McCartney’s “Back in the U.S.” tour in 2001. Check in with Kai back in 2009 and you’ll have found him recording 8 tracks on Bone Thugs-N-Harmony’s “The World’s Enemy” CD. He was based in LA during this part of his career and worked on everything from heavy metal to country, before making the move to Pittsburgh 4 years ago. Since arriving in the City of Bridges, Kai has played with Mike Sheer, Craig King, Eric Johnson (jazz), Tony Campbell, and others at Backstage Bar, Thunderbird, R Bar, and James Street. You’ll find him teaching drumming at Nstuff Music where he continues to share his passion with the next generation. Enter your Username and Password to login to your account. Don't have an account?

Depictions of the crucified Christ are common in both churches and art museums, though the specifics can vary widely. The Bible gives scant details and leaves a lot of room for imagination, and artists of every era have been quick to add their own creative touches. From Byzantine works that adhered closely to theological doctrine, to Western wealthy patrons with their own ideas about how the crucifixion should be shown, to modern artists creating passionate testaments to their personal beliefs as well as their views on politics and social justice, there is much to examine through visual representations of this singular, profound event. Arcangelo Cola da Camerino, Italian, The Madonna and Child, Enthroned; Crucifixion, circa 1420-1422, tempera on panel, 20 x 23 1/4 in. Frick Art & Historical Center.

The Frick Pittsburgh is an exceptional example of a planned gift at its most generous—Helen Clay Frick left provisions in her will for Clayton, her childhood family home, to be restored and opened to the public along with The Frick Art Museum and the family’s car and carriage collection. That foresight has enabled The Frick Pittsburgh to evolve into the unique museum we have today. You, too, can create a legacy that will help ensure that the Frick continues to serve students and families well into the future. In addition to making a difference in the lives of others, a planned gift can provide tax savings or income benefits for you and your family. There are many ways to make such a gift—simple methods include gifts in your will or living trust, gifts of life insurance, gifts of retirement assets, and more. To make the process of legacy giving easy, The Frick has partnered with FreeWill for our community to create an estate plan for free. FreeWill’s secure online tool empowers you to write a legally valid will or trust in about 20 minutes. As you write your will, FreeWill presents you with the opportunity to make a planned gift to The Frick on your terms. If you have ‘non-probate’ assets like a life insurance policy that you’d like to donate, you can use this FreeWill tool to log all of these assets and name The Frick as a beneficiary. If you have already created a legacy by including a gift in your estate plan, will you please complete this form to let us know? This helps us update our records and thank you for building a legacy to support The Frick’s authentic experiences with art, history, and nature. Dr. Moitra understands the impact that art, history, and nature can have on someone. As a graduate student, Moitra appreciated the ability to come and visit the The Frick Art Museum for free when he didn’t have many resources. “I think it’s so important to have this opportunity, especially if you’re interested in art but can’t afford to pay the price of admission,” Moitra says. As an adult, Moitra retained his love of art and was compelled to join the Frick as a member, remembering the effect the museums had on him in his younger years. Thinking about his own legacy, he also decided to make a planned gift to the Frick, knowing that his gift would make it possible for future generations of students to visit, as he had. The Frick has been a key part of Dr. Moitra’s life for many years, and he feels it is important to give back, support the future of the institution, and ensure that anyone can find sanctuary on our campus. We are so thankful for members like Dr. Moitra, who have a positive impact on everything we do here. While some prefer to leave a gift in their wills or estates, others appreciate the increased flexibility of a beneficiary designation. You might consider using: It only takes three simple steps to name The Frick Pittsburgh as a beneficiary: Thank you for considering The Frick Pittsburgh to be the recipient of these gifts from the heart. It’s truly an honor to be included in the legacy of someone who cares so deeply about providing accessible cultural assets in the Pittsburgh region.

Frick Societies members enjoy all the benefits of membership, plus much more! 1882 is the year that Henry Clay Frick purchased the Italianate-style home we know today as Clayton, the cornerstone of the Frick’s collections. Members of the 1882 Society are, likewise, cornerstones of the vital philanthropic support necessary to advance the museum’s mission. The Rubens Society is named after the renowned seventeenth-century Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, whose Portrait of Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency, Princess of Condé (ca. 1610) is one of the most admired works in the Frick’s collection. Named for the enduring history of the Frick family’s Gilded Age home, the Clayton Society is composed of individuals committed to the sustainability and future of The Frick Pittsburgh. Recognized by Architectural Digest as "a triumph of restoration," Clayton is a stunning late-nineteenth-century mansion, and the only surviving example of a home on Pittsburgh’s lost "Millionaire’s Row." The Helen Clay Frick Society honors the legacy of the Frick’s founder and benefactress. Members enjoy the distinction of being part of a vital group to support the Frick’s mission to provide memorable experiences with art, history, and nature that inspire and delight.

"Our tour guide was excellent! Her knowledge and command of the history was excellent. It was clear that she has a love of her job. That's engaging. We had a youngster (about 10 - 12 years old) in our group. He was very bright and was not shy. Our guide did an excellent job of responding to him while not losing track of her objective. She integrated his quizzical mind into the interaction. It was actually amusing to the entire group. I really appreciate the efforts that the museum put into the development of the new tours." - William S.

Pittsburgh Area Farmers' Markets and U-Pick Farms Pittsburgh food has always been rooted in tradition and fresh off the farm. As a result, farmers' markets are a well established part of Pittsburgh culture. There are more farmers' markets and community gardens per capita in Pittsburgh than in most U.S. metropolitan areas. In season, you can find one just about every day of the week in different neighborhoods. Whether it's a church parking lot, a sidewalk stand, or a tent off the side of the road, these markets sell local farm fresh produce, eggs, cheese, homemade baked goods, jams and honey. Some farmers' markets even sell Amish-made wood furniture and rugs. For a complete list of Pittsburgh area farmers' markets, click here. If you want to get a little closer to your food, try harvesting your own produce at Pittsburgh area U-Pick Farms. You'll get some exercise as well as a great big bunch of fresh produce you picked yourself. Visiting a u-pick farm is a great family experience that is both fun and educational. There's something about harvesting your own food that makes you appreciate it more. Many U-Pick farms also have on-site stores selling other ready-to-go products from their farm. Many Pittsburgh area residents enter in to a more formal agreement with local farmers to ensure their seasonal supply of farm fresh products; including farm fresh beef and other meats. This is a relatively new and growing trend called, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). These agreements, and the products offered, vary by farm and help local families enjoy a variety of farm fresh products while providing local farmers a profitable outlet for their harvest. 72 0 Saved
