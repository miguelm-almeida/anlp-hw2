Partnering with the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership offers a wide range of highly visible opportunities to reach the Downtown business, civic, and cultural leadership, professional community, and residents. And Downtown is the one place you can also reach a large concentration of people from all across the region at the same time. Many PDP initiatives offer market-wide advertising and publicity campaigns or other strategic benefits that amplify your support.

PDP programs are dedicated to improving the economic and social conditions in Downtown Pittsburgh, essential to the vitality of the entire city and 10-county metro region. You can advance your business goals and be part of the momentum shaping our Downtown by supporting dynamic initiatives such as the Market Square Farmers Market, Light Up Night®, The Downtown Holiday Shopping Season, Market Square Public Art Program, Downtown resident events, PDP research reports, PDP membership events, and many others.
