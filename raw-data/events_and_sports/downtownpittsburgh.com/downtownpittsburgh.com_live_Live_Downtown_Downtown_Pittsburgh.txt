Living in Downtown Pittsburgh means living in the center of it all: world-class theaters, nationally-recognized dining destinations, historic architecture, professional sports teams, beautiful parks, and the energy of urban living are all right on your doorstep.

Downtown is the most exciting neighborhood in one of the most dynamic cities in the country. In the past ten years, over $1.9 billion has been invested in improving the neighborhood and more than 3,750 new residents have moved in. Young professionals, empty nesters, families, and more are making their new home in Downtown Pittsburgh.

Why are more and more Pittsburghers moving into Downtown?
