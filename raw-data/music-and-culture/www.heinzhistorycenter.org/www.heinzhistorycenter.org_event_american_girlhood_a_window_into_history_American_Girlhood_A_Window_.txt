Celebrate the joy of girlhood during a multigenerational celebration of storytelling and history.

Presented in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh’s Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, this special day focused on America’s favorite historical dolls will feature a book talk with three American Girl book series authors, a delightful tea party, paper doll making, and more.

Anchoring the program are authors Connie Porter (the ADDY WALKER® series), Jackie Greene (the REBECCA RUBIN TM series), and Wendy Wan-Long Shang (CORINNE ® series) who will share their experiences writing the powerful narratives of these beloved characters. The trio will discuss how they framed important historical events and issues for younger audiences while also imparting lessons of resilience, friendship, and empowerment throughout.

Ahead of the book talk, kids and kids-at-heart are invited (with their dolls!) to an enchanting tea party that Samantha, Molly, and Felicity would be proud of! Enjoy light refreshments and imaginative play while you sip, savor, and socialize.

Throughout the day, you can also dip into your own childhood nostalgia and design a paper doll with the University of Pittsburgh’s Book Making Club, view girlhood-inspired artifacts in the Detre Library & Archives, learn about the American Girl Doll Lending Program at local libraries, participate in a themed scavenger hunt, and browse the Riverstone Books pop-up shop.

Join us to celebrate these iconic dolls that have inspired generations of girls to face challenges with courage and recognize the strength in their stories.
