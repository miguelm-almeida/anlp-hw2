Your involvement is more than an investment in a vibrant city center; it’s about creating an inclusive and dynamic neighborhood in which to live, work and visit.

From the ever-expanding popularity of Picklesburgh, to the bustling outdoor dining scene, to dedicated services that keep our streets safe and clean, our mission is to foster a Downtown that is welcoming to all, and our members are vital part of everything we do.

As a member, you’ll join a diverse network of stakeholders who share in our vision for Downtown and the region as a whole. You’ll also gain access to exclusive resources and promotional support, including members-only events, networking opportunities, recognition on our website and social platforms, and special discounts and perks at PDP programs.

We invite you to join our community of like-minded organizations, businesses, and individuals who are dedicated to making Downtown a place we can all take pride in.
