A donor-advised fund, or DAF, can be a flexible, easy way to support your favorite organizations. Think of it as a charitable savings account that offers immediate tax benefits and can maximize your long-term philanthropic impact.

Step 1: Contact your DAF sponsor to recommend a one-time or recurring grant to CMU. Include the designation where you would like your grant directed. You may need CMUâ€™s address and tax ID to properly direct the gift:

Address: Carnegie Mellon University, 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 Federal Tax ID Number: 25-0969449

Step 2: Let CMU know at gift-administration@andrew.cmu.edu or 412-268-2582 about your DAF recommendation so we can thank you and ensure that your donation is allocated according to your wishes.

Step 3: Consider naming CMU and your other favorite charities as beneficiaries of your DAF as part of your broader estate planning strategy.

If your donor-advised fund is with Fidelity, Schwab or BNY Mellon, you may recommend a gift to CMU via DAFDirect.

Or, you can use this tool to search for your sponsor and be redirected to its page:

As always, please consult with your personal legal, tax and financial counsel to ensure a DAF is right for you and prior to making a charitable gift.
