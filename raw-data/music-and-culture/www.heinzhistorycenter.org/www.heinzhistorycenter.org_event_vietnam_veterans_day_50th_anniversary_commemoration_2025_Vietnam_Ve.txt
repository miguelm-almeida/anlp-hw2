Join the Veterans Breakfast Club on National Vietnam War Veterans Day.

This Vietnam Veterans Day event will honor and recognize all veterans who served on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces at any time during the period of Nov. 1, 1955, to May 15, 1975, regardless of duty location. The event will feature veteran’s stories and recognition as well as the pinning of our Vietnam-era veterans.

Non-veterans are welcome to attend and pay tribute to our Vietnam War veterans, hear their stories of service, and thank them for blazing the trail for every serviceman and servicewoman who came after them.

The event will be held in-person at the History Center and will also be streamed on Facebook and YouTube.

The program is free with advance registration. Please register in advance online.

Every Vietnam Veteran registered for this event will receive a special VBC 64-page Limited Edition Commemorative Book with VBC Vietnam stories and history.
