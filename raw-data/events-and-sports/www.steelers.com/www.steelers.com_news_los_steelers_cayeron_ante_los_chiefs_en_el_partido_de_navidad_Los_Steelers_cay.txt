Los Pittsburgh Steelers cayeron en casa 29-10 ante los Kansas City Chiefs en el partido correspondiente a la semana 17 en Navidad. Los Chiefs fueron superiores dentro del terreno de juego y si a eso le sumamos castigos en situaciones clave y un par de intercambios de balÃ3n muy dolorosos se puede explicar la razÃ3n de haber salido sin la victoria.

"No estamos haciendo las cosas bÃ¡sicas y fundamentales de buena manera, estamos perdiendo mucho el balÃ3n y no estamos forzando intercambios a nuestro favor. No estamos generando jugadas de alto impacto y no puedes ganar un juego contra un rival de ese calibre anotando 10 puntos" comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin ante los medios de comunicaciÃ3n tras el partido.

Los Steelers fueron doblegados por el brazo de Mahomes, quiÃ©n lanzÃ3 para 320 yardas y tres pases de anotaciÃ3n. La lÃ­nea ofensiva de los Chiefs luciÃ3 muy fuerte y no permitieron capturas. Del otro lado la historia fue diferente, la lÃ­nea ofensiva de los Steelers sufriÃ3 para poder proteger a Russell Wilson, quien sufriÃ3 cinco capturas en el partido.

El juego arrancÃ3 bravo, los Chiefs anotaron en sus primeras dos series ofensivas y fallaron un punto extra, la diferencia era de 13 puntos, la ofensiva moviÃ3 bien el balÃ3n pero cuando llegÃ3 a zona roja, Russell Wilson lanzÃ3 una intercepciÃ3n que impactÃ3 en el marcador. Ya en el segundo cuarto Wilson anotÃ3 el Ãonico touchdown del equipo con una carrera de una yarda.

El juego terrestre ahora no fue factor Najee Harris y Jaylen Warren tuvieron mÃ¡s de 70 yardas por tierra y Russell Wilson 55 yardas pero eso no fue suficiente para marcar diferencia a la ofensiva, los 10 puntos de este miÃ©rcoles contra los Chiefs es la menor cantidad de puntos de la ofensiva desde la semana 13 del 2023 contra Arizona.

Hay que darle vuelta a la hoja y pensar en el cierre de campaÃ±a en contra de los Bengals y en llegar con un mejor ritmo y con los errores corregidos de camino a los playoffs en el mes de enero.

Feliz Navidad

Here we go!
