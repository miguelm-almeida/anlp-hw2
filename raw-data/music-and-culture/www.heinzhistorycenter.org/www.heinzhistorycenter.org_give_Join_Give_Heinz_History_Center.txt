Visitors can help sustain the legacy of the History Center in a variety of ways.

Celebrate the ‘can do’ spirit and rich history of the Pittsburgh region by attending an annual History Center fundraising event.

Preserve your memories and celebrate loved ones by purchasing a lasting gift inside the History Center. From time capsules and personalized floor tiles to rocking chairs and commemorative sports items, the museum can help preserve your own piece of history for generations to come.

Including the History Center in your estate planning directly supports the museum’s mission while providing tax benefits for you and your benefactors. A wide variety of planned giving options are available, including charitable trusts and bequests.

The Heinz History Center actively seeks artifacts and archival materials related to the history of Western Pennsylvania and the experiences of its people, both past and present. If you have an object, photo, or other archival material that you think is of historic significance, we want to hear from you!

Can your employer match your gift? You can double or triple your gift if you or your spouse work for an organization that matches charitable contributions to the History Center. Please contact your organization’s human resources department for their matching gift policy.

You can also make a donation by contacting Lauren Meals at 412-454-6351 or [email protected].

Please note that the Senator John Heinz History Center’s IRS legal name is the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania.
