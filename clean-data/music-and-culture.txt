Since its invention in 1904, the Banana Split has become an iconic part of American dessert culture. Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old “soda jerk” at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream – typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry – and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit! The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Strickler’s banana-based sundaes quickly became known as “Dr. Dave’s” among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert. Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry. Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90. In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split, “Ice-Cream Joe” Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Strickler’s invention with the “From Pitt Came the Split” Event. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassel’s Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record. Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania! David Strickler Inside Strickler’s Drug Store Outside Strickler’s Drug Store Photos courtesy of the Latrobe Historical Society The legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the town’s claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the “From Pitt Came the Split” event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013. From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebration’s honorary chair. We respect your privacy.

There’s no cultural organization in the world quite like Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. With a legacy of discovery and outreach dating back to 1895, today we are a family of four diverse, dynamic museums: Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center, and The Andy Warhol Museum. We’re committed to being inclusive, both on-site and online, and to exploring with our audiences the big ideas and issues of our time. Our mission: To preserve and expand the resources of art and science as agents of personal growth and social advancement in Pittsburgh and beyond. Our Core Values. Our Vision for Impact. Copies of Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh’s Federal IRS form 990 and audited financial statements are available upon request. Check out some fascinating highlights from 1895 to today. Each of the four Carnegie Museums has its own distinct personality and incredible experiences to offer. As the largest and most far-reaching cultural organization in the Pittsburgh region, each year Carnegie Museums serves 1.5 million people, including more than 249,000 schoolchildren. Our example as a cultural leader and champion of the Pittsburgh region starts at the top.

> The history of Carnegie Museums is bookended by two periods of fantastic growth and diversification. It all started in November of 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. Andrew Carnegie called the original Oakland building—which included Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh—his “monument,” and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. That’s saying a lot, considering that this son of a poor Scottish weaver grew up to become one of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International, second only to the Venice Biennale as the world’s oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museum’s collection of art quickly grew as a result. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of “colossal” prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs. The first Carnegie International, 1896 To make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii, Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums’ first major expansion in 1904. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture, perhaps best embodied Andrew Carnegie’s desire to “bring the world” to the people of Pittsburgh. He knew that most of those people would never leave their neighborhoods, their city, let alone the country. So he created a room filled with the casts of some of the greatest architectural wonders of the world. The hall itself is modeled after one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and its rare collection of casts is the largest on display anywhere in the world today. The 1907 expansion Early Dinosaur Hall The Hall of Architecture Adding two new museums Carnegie Museums’ second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries, which gave Carnegie Museum of Art’s constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls: Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife. In 1986, the expanding cultural powerhouse became known as “The Carnegie,” and to this day, many in the region still refer to Andrew Carnegie’s Pittsburgh museums as The Carnegie. In 1991, Carnegie Science Center entered the Carnegie Museums fold through a partnership between Carnegie Museums and the Buhl Foundation. Home to Buhl Planetarium, the Miniature Railroad & Village, and hundreds of interactive science exhibits, the Science Center now attracts more than half a million people a year. By the time of its 10-year anniversary in 2001, the Science Center opened Highmark SportsWorks, the largest collection of sports and science exhibits in the world. Carnegie Science Center Three years later, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: The Andy Warhol Museum. In addition to presenting the vast archives of Andy Warhol, the museum also has become a center for dialogue about a diverse range of topics, as well as a global ambassador to Pittsburgh’s cultural richness and diversity through its many traveling exhibitions. The Andy Warhol Museum Today’s ever-changing experiences By the year 2000, the four Carnegie Museums became known as “Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.” The following two decades included the debut of Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s blockbuster Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibit, which is nearly three times the size of the original dinosaur hall and the first exhibit in the world to feature scientifically accurate, immersive environments spanning the Age of Dinosaurs. In 2003 and again in 2012, Carnegie Museum of Art accomplished its most important and most visitor-focused transformations since the opening of the Scaife wing with the reopening of its Scaife Galleries after year-long renovations, which included new presentations of its vast collections and the display of more artwork. In 2014, The Andy Warhol Museum rehung its collection, telling the story of Andy Warhol’s life and artwork chronologically for the first time to spectacular effect. In 2017, Carnegie Museums launched a collaborative event series, Carnegie Nexus, that reaches across the arts and sciences to design experiences that animate pressing issues of our time and instigate new ways to examine our world through live performance, the visual and literary arts, and thoughtful conversation. And in 2018, Carnegie Science Center completed a major expansion: PPG Science Pavilion, which houses a suite of STEM Learning Labs; a Special Exhibitions Gallery for large-scale changing exhibitions; a laser digital giant-screen theater; and outdoor learning spaces on the riverfront.

> Carnegie Museum of Art was the first museum in the United States with a strong focus on contemporary art, instructed by its founder, Andrew Carnegie, to collect the “old masters of tomorrow” at the inception of the Carnegie International in 1896. Today, it’s one of the most dynamic major art institutions in the country. As one of the country’s largest and most respected natural history museums, Carnegie Museum of Natural History plays a critical role in both the Pittsburgh region and the international scientific community by conducting research and presenting exhibitions and programs that highlight the interdependence of humanity and nature, and advocating for the protection of the earth and its inhabitants. The museum’s millions of objects and specimens form one of the world’s great archives of biodiversity and the history of life. Carnegie Science Center, soon to be the Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center, is dedicated to inspiring learning and curiosity by connecting science and technology with everyday life. By making science both relevant and fun, the Science Center’s goal is to increase science literacy in the region and motivate young people to seek careers in science and technology. As the region’s most-visited museum, the Science Center reaches 500,000 people annually through hands-on exhibits, camps, classes, and off-site programs. The most comprehensive single-artist museum in the world, The Andy Warhol Museum illuminates the art, life, and times of one of the most influential American artists of the 20th century. Combining artworks, images, and objects from Warhol's colorful life, the museum takes visitors on a tour of Andy Warhol's personal and professional life—from Andy Warhol the Pittsburgh art student to Andy Warhol the Pop icon. With some 500,000 artworks and objects, the museum is the global keeper of Warhol's legacy. ©2025 Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Support

Hope Gillespie There’s a movie poster of Harrison Ford’s iconic character Indiana Jones fixed to Hope Gillespie’s office wall at Carnegie Science Center. It is there for professional inspiration as much as workplace decor. “I cannot overstate the influence Indiana Jones has had on my life,” says Gillespie, who is the museum experiences officer at the Science Center. The film franchise piqued her interest in archaeology—she holds a bachelor’s degree in archaeology from The George Washington University and a master’s degree in the discipline from University College London. But she also just loves the character’s catchphrase about artifacts—“It belongs in a museum”—that informs her work to this day. Since joining the Science Center in 2021, Gillespie has put her archaeology background to use by spending months researching upcoming exhibitions. Her work ranges from studying delicate waterlogged objects in TITANIC: The Artifact Exhibition, the blockbuster exhibition that closed in April, to researching the process of animation for The Science Behind Pixar, which opened May 25. Gillespie trains staff and produces supplementary materials to enhance exhibitions. She also spends a lot of time answering visitors’ questions, which is the part of her job she loves most. “I love teaching,” Gillespie says. “I didn’t think that informal education was my superpower until I started to do it.” Gina Winstead Marcus Harshaw Gretchen Baker Trương Công Tùng, installation view of the state of absence—voices from outside, 2020, in the 58th Carnegie International, Courtesy of the artist and Carnegie Museum of Art.

Many know parts of the story of the 1922 discovery of King Tutankhamun’s tomb in Egypt’s the Valley of the Kings.

Or contact us about your upcoming wedding: Image Gallery Popular wedding spaces include: Oakland Museums Carnegie Science Center The Andy Warhol Museum The reception last week was flawless! It has been a real pleasure to work with you throughout our planning, and your staff was very helpful last week. Everyone was unbelievably pleasant, and our guests were impressed with the venue and the service. It was nice to relax and enjoy the evening knowing that we were in great hands. Adding on the Founders Room at the last minute proved to be a good decision, and I appreciate everyone who also made that a good experience. Thank you again for being such a valuable resource; you really helped us have a positive experience. Adria Banko – 7/16/22 Dear All, We don’t know how to begin to thank you for Colleen & Eric’s Wedding day. Everything and every detail was perfect!! The room looked spectacular and the food was amazing (as well as the amazing wedding cake, which got rave reviews)!! You all did a fantastic job and Trish & I are very grateful! Colleen & Eric could not have been happier the way things turned out and that’s what really matters. Again, Trish and I thank you for everything you did for us and the newlyweds, we really appreciate it!! Kevin & Trish – 6/18/2022 Hello Vanessa, Now that the craziness of our wedding day is over and our emotions have settled, I would like to thank you for your help in making our wedding possible. Your efforts to help get us acclimated to the venue, answer all of our questions, and address all of our concerns over the past year have been exceptional. The venue was absolutely spectacular and directly matched the vision that my wife (still getting used to saying and writing that identifier!) and I sought to witness and present to our guests. Everything from the spacious layout of the tables and chairs to the presentation of the glassware at each table to the depiction of the cookie table was done to perfection! You helped realize our dream, and for that we are incredibly thankful! We would not have known that you were newer to the “Events Manager” role if you had not told us. You did a fabulous job of presenting the information and details to us at the pertinent times and made us feel comfortable throughout the entire process. We cannot keep track of how many people thoroughly enjoyed our wedding, with many of them saying it was the best wedding that they had ever attended! We could not have reaped this praise without your guidance and leadership. Thank you for making the day a memory for life for my wife and me. We still feel beyond excited every time we realize we had our wedding reception at the Science Center! Without you, this would have not been possible! I am currently recommending PointView Hall as a venue to some of my newly engaged friends who are looking to host their wedding. Your name is also being linked to this recommendation, as we feel very confident that you will provide the same quality of service to them as you did to us. I will be sure to contact you in the future should there be another event I would be interested in hosting. Thank you very much! Chandler McGovern-Johnson Wedding – 5/14/2022 Dallas, Thank you so much for all of your hard work in making our wedding day perfect! We so enjoyed working with you and the entire Carnegie museums team for our reception. We absolutely loved how the space turned out and have heard endless compliments on the food. Thank you again for making our day so special. Sydney Dombrowski – 4/23/22 Dallas, Cassie, and Lindsay, Thank you all so much for making our wedding unforgettable. Our guests were blown away by the hospitality, food, and space (hats off to Mr. Carnegie, he had wonderful taste in décor). Our night would not have functioned as well as it did if it weren’t for you ladies and your team. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We truly appreciate everything you did. Much love, The Grubers – 4/23/2022 Good evening! I just wanted to send a big thank you to you and your team at the science center. I got my wedding gallery back today and everything was an absolute dream. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making my day so special. All of our guests could not stop raving about the cocktail hour, food, the ballroom, and view. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Jayne and Conner Phillips – 4/2/2022 Dallas, Thank you so much for everything you have done these past few years. You made what could have been a stressful experience moving a wedding four times not very stressful at all. We appreciate you more than you know, and it has been an absolute pleasure working with you. So happy to finally be able to celebrate! Josh and Taylor Davis – 1/16/2022 Bridgitte, Holy crap!!! Thank you so much for everything! Our wedding was absolutely amazing! Everything was perfect! You are such a freaking Rockstar! You have such a wonderful team and we cannot thank you enough. Thank you for being diligent, kind, and prompt. You took wedding planning and it fun and stress free. Thank you so much! We are forever grateful for you, your team and The Warhol Catherine and Jessica – 12/11/2021 A Night to Remember While looking for a venue, my now husband and I wanted somewhere close to downtown with beautiful views, and paired well with our nerdy side. After visiting the Science Center for a tour of the space we knew immediately this was where we wanted our reception to be held. The entire staff and team we coordinated with was so professional, helpful and easy to work with that we fully were able to enjoy the entire evening! The ability to have catering included was a huge bonus for us, as well and not needing to looking into bartenders and other staff. We had such a wonderful night and highly recommend checking out Point View Hall for a larger space! Caitrin F. – 11/13/2021 Dear Dallas, Cassie, & Trista Thank you all so much for helping us organize our wedding on October 23. We felt you all did an exceptional job, we can’t thank you enough for helping to calm our nerves with your excellent attention to detail. If there’s anything we can do in the future (customer reviews, recommendations, etc.) please let us know! All our very best wishes, Sarah and Oliver – 10/23/2021 Dear Dallas, We don’t have the words to thank you enough for all that you did for us. Our wedding was 100% a fairy tale...literally the best night of our lives! You kept us calm during the whole process of planning a pandemic wedding and you’re just so damned nice! The museum is truly lucky to have you and we are so happy we had our wedding there. Trista and Lenny Weiss – 6/26/2021 “Thank you so much for making my daughter’s wedding such a memorable event. It was hard enough to be dealing with Covid-19 without the added stress of a wedding but you were amazing! You went above and beyond the call of duty from zooming the entire event so our friends and family could see it to helping our photographer and working with the music. The Carnegie Museum is such a fabulous place to have a wedding and I think it’s an underused resource in Pittsburgh. Being wed under the T-Rex is just an amazing setting. This was my daughter’s dream wedding for years and you made it possible.” 10/1/2020 What all is included in the rental fee? Tables/chairs, custodial services, limited technical services, entrance security, and someone from the special events office to oversee the event. Things that are prohibited: Sparklers indoors/outdoors, bubbles, dropped/tossed flower petals, confetti indoors/outside, open-flame tapered candles, popcorn, balloons, and open flames. Can anything be hung up? In most cases, we ask that nothing be hung on the walls and signage be free-standing. But that depends on the venue. Just tell us what you have in mind. What time does my event have to end? In most cases, we ask that events end by 1 a.m. Let us know if this is a problem for you event. Do you have a preferred catering list? We partner with our exclusive caterer, Culinaire. Can I bring in cookies for a wedding? Yes! We love the Pittsburgh Cookie Table tradition. Are linens included in fees? Yes, they are included in our wedding package (but not in our other events packages). Can I take pictures in Museum galleries? You can absolutely take photographs in all event spaces. Museum gallery photography varies, however. Just ask us. What about storage for my event? All items that come into the museum must leave the same day. Do you have any preferred vendors? You are welcome to contract the florist and/or entertainment of your choice. We are happy to make recommendations, if needed. How does parking work? Our museums have different parking operations, so please contact your event manager, who will be happy to share venue-specific information. Can you suggest additional museum experiences for my guests? Yes! We can provide docent-led tours of galleries, live demonstrations, and other museum experiences for an additional fee. We look forward to working with you to create the perfect catering package for your wedding day.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Since our founding in 1939, Pittsburgh Opera has enriched the Pittsburgh region by bringing live, world-class opera to our community. We have long been committed to making opera accessible to a diverse audience, but we recognize that a more focused outlook is necessary to ensure that our organization reflects the ideals of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA), in our public offerings as well as internally. Pittsburgh Opera is dedicated to fostering a culture of mutual respect - respect for all stories, voices, experiences, and contributions. We aim to reflect this culture both through our leadership structure, programming choices, and employment policies, as well as through our interactions with our audience and the larger community. We recognize and celebrate the rich cultural history of opera while also acknowledging that the classic repertoire is largely European and does not include the perspective or experience of many marginalized communities. Because of this history, it has been especially essential that Pittsburgh Opera recognizes these biases and continues to bring more diverse voices both to our stage and to our staff. For many years, Pittsburgh Opera has provided a platform for contemporary works on the main stage as well as part of our Second Stage Project. Through world premieres such as 2017’s The Summer King, about baseball legend Josh Gibson, and productions of As One and 27, we continue to showcase work by diverse composers and librettists, sung by diverse artists, and supported by a diverse artistic and administrative staff. In addition, Pittsburgh Opera embraces a continued commitment to growth and conversation, as outlined by the following principles: The Summer King: The Josh Gibson Story. 2017.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Pittsburgh Opera enriches Pittsburgh and the tri-state area and draws national and international attention to the region by: The current leader of Pittsburgh Opera is Christopher Hahn, who became Artistic Director in 2000 and General Director in 2008. During his tenure he has considerably expanded the company’s repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Opera’s high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded the Resident Artist Program to include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move to Bitz Opera Factory in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there. Pittsburgh Opera's current Music Director, Antony Walker, was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the company’s musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note. Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here. Founded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburgh’s Tuesday Musical Club (pianist Virginia C. Byerly; contralto Carolyn Hunt Mahaffey; Priscilla W. Collins; Ruby N. Wickersham; and Marie M. Pease), these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States. The first production, in March 1940 at Carnegie Music Hall, was The Tales of Hoffmann, with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. The company’s first conductor, Richard Karp of Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the company’s move to Heinz Hall in 1971. In 1983, Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Opera’s General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera. Mark Weinstein’s appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the company’s growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning. He increased the company’s assets threefold and cemented the Opera’s reputation as a leader in financial management in the region. Weinstein initiated the Artistic Excellence Project, and raised major funds which led to the appointment of Christopher Hahn as Artistic Director in 2000 and John Mauceri as Music Director in 2001. In 2008 Pittsburgh Opera moved to its current and permanent home in the Strip District, finally achieving the space to house the resources needed to better prepare for performances at the Benedum, while opening new ways for the community to experience all the artistry that is part of opera. In an effort to maintain the Company’s mission to enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, the Opera has committed to the use of sustainable methods in the renovation and maintenance of the Bitz Opera Factory, obtaining a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Operations and Maintenance Silver Certification in June 2011. In addition to its mainstage productions, Pittsburgh Opera produces a range of programs to engage and enrich the community, with more than 15,000 students, families and educators participating in its educational events annually. The internationally-renowned Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Program is among the country’s top five training centers for rising opera stars and the newly designed administrative and rehearsal space provides for events ranging from free community Song Shop Concerts to concert recitals by world-class opera singers. Pittsburgh Opera’s long-standing commitment to artistic excellence, responsible fiscal management and good neighborship will continue to prove a valuable asset to the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region for years to come. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Your opera journey begins today! Intimidated by opera? Don't be! Let's debunk some common opera myths together!If you’ve never been to the opera before, you may have some misconceptions. Don't worry, you're not alone! So let's shake off your preconceptions and learn what going to the opera is really like... Come as you are or glam it up! On weeknights people often show up in what they wore to the office that day, and on Fridays and Sundays, we see everything from dressy to jeans. On Saturdays – opening nights – some like to wear a suit or step out in a special dress. But just wear whatever makes you feel comfortable! Everyone in this photo is dressed perfectly for the opera! (Photo credit: David Bachman) Tickets to Pittsburgh Opera's mainstage shows at the Benedum and Byham start at only $15... children and teens can even get in at half that price. That's less than a movie ticket and some popcorn! There are even discounts for groups of 6+, students, 20-Something Tuesdays and more. English texts are always projected above the stage, just like subtitles at the movies. While many operas are in Italian, German, or French, there are many in English too. You'll understand every word! Do you think sword fights are boring? What about dancing, poisonings, secret plots, epic romances, or twist endings? Operas have these in spades! That's why the term "operatic" has come to mean "dramatic to the nth degree." These two will slice your notions of "boring" to threads! (Photo credit: David Bachman) Operas come in all shapes and sizes! The shortest opera we know of is 13 minutes long, and the longest one takes 7 days! You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under "Details and Resources." Many operas are the same length as any musical or play, with an intermission or two along the way. Just like music has changed a lot in the last 400 years, opera has too! While almost all operas make use of "classical voice technique," which give operas their signature vocal style, the musical style can vary from Baroque to even Hip Hop! We Shall Not Be Moved lays down fresh beats (Video credit: RLG Creations) Some playful 18th century coluratura from Semele (Video credit: RLG Creations) Some rousing 19th century bravado from Carmen (Video credit: RLG creations) A jazzy number from Charlie Parker's Yardbird (Video credit: RLG Creations) You don’t need to study before you go to the opera any more than you have to study before you go to a movie! Opera is a performing art meant to be enjoyed as is. For people who want to familiarize themselves with the plot in advance, there is a synopsis on the opera’s webpage and program books. And if you want to nerd out you can go to the Pre Opera Talk, Meet The Artists, or pick up a Study Guide at our education table. But you don’t need to do any of those to enjoy the show and understand what’s happening! Not so! There are many comic operas, operas for children, and heartwarming love stories too. While there are operas that will truly break your heart or scare you to your core, opera plays with every human emotion, especially the good ones! Who doesn't love a happy ending?

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Pittsburgh Opera offers an Audio Commentary service for patrons with visual impairments during the Tuesday* performances at all our productions (unless other date is specified). Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as hear descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A patron may reserve a seat in advance by calling , extension 213. An all-volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. An audio describer reads from the program book ten minutes before the performance—the "pre-show"—and then reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage during the performance—the "play-by-play". We're thankful to our volunteers who provide this service each season! Pittsburgh Opera Audio Commentary Team— Julia, Ray, Jan, Donna, and Mary Ann Braille and large-print programs are available at each performance. Infrared hearing devices are available at our Benedum Center performances. Channel 1 on the Infrared Hearing Devices is for audio amplification. Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Please see our accessibility webpage for details. The Study Guides for each opera are posted in PDF format on the Pittsburgh Opera website in advance of the opera's opening, and are available in paper form at all performances, in the lobby area. For more information about Pittsburgh Opera programs for Adults, please email Marilyn Michalka Egan, Ph.D., Director of Education, or call her at , ext. 242. Pittsburgh Opera provides several courses each season through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.

Connecting the opera to the community, this program provides opportunities for parents and children from select Pittsburgh neighborhoods to attend opera performances together—to experience art as a family. At Pittsburgh Opera, we believe in reaching out to our friends who might not normally be able to attend arts performances, and we believe in preparing them to attend through pre-performance workshops. What better way to experience the magic of opera than to attend with a family member!

Pittsburgh Opera launched our mobile app in 2016, to provide patrons with easy access to information about our productions, artists, and events. The app is powered by Instant Encore, the leading provider of mobile solutions to performing arts organizations around the globe. In the fall of 2018, Instant Encore began offering its customers a premium feature within its platform called Live Note®. Created by the Philadelphia Orchestra in partnership with Drexel University’s Expressive and Creative Interaction Technologies (ExCITe) Center, LiveNote® initially delivered visual content (e.g. text and photographs) to patrons during orchestra performances. Pittsburgh Opera began carefully testing this functionality during our fall 2018 performances of Madama Butterfly and Hansel & Gretel. Pre-selected audience members served as beta testers and provided positive feedback on their experiences. Thanks to an Innovation Grant from OPERA America funded by the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation, Pittsburgh Opera partnered with Instant Encore to add real-time audio capabilities to LiveNote®. We began testing these capabilities in January 2019 at our performances of afterWARds – Mozart’s Idomeneo Reimagined, and continued testing throughout the remainder of our 2018-19 season. Great care had already been taken to ensure the app would not disrupt nearby patrons. After our 2018-19 season ended, Pittsburgh Opera and Instant Encore added additional safeguards to minimize light seepage and reduce the risk of incoming phone calls startling users. With these additional safeguards in place, we publicly rolled out the functionality at the beginning of our 2019-20 season. We will continue to monitor and adjust the app over time. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Music by Giacomo PucciniLibretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa • OCTOBER 18, 21, 24, 26, 2025 When a candle flickers, love sparks.Set against the backdrop of 1830’s Paris, La Bohème follows four impoverished artists surviving with little more than friendship, passion, and their love for art. When Roldolfo, a poet, and Mimì, a young seamstress, meet, the two are drawn into a tumultuous and passionate affair with a love that can only be broken by death.La Bohème will make you laugh, and bring you to tears, with its timeless story and captivating music. Emotional and dramatic, it’s no wonder Puccini’s most celebrated opera has transcended the genre, inspiring both a ballet and the Broadway hit musical RENT. Antony Walker conducts; Kristine McIntyre directs.These performances are sponsored in part by The Gailliot Fund.

In their Latin Quarter garret on Christmas Eve, the painter Marcello and poet Rodolfo try to keep warm by burning pages from Rodolfo's latest drama. They are joined by their comrades—Colline, a young philosopher, and Schaunard, a musician who has landed a job and brings food, fuel, and funds (Legna! . . . Sigari!). While they celebrate their unexpected fortune, the landlord, Benoit, arrives to collect the rent. Plying the older man with wine, they urge him to tell of his flirtations, then throw him out in mock indignation. As the friends depart for a celebration at the nearby Café Momus, Rodolfo promises to join them soon, staying behind to finish writing an article. There’s another knock; a neighbor, Mimì, says her candle has gone out on the drafty stairs. Offering her wine when she feels faint, Rodolfo relights her candle and helps her to the door. Mimì realizes she has dropped her key, and as the two search for it, both candles are blown out. In the moonlight the poet takes the girl's shivering hand (Che gelida manina "What a cold little hand") telling her his dreams. She then recounts her solitary life (Sì, mi chiamano Mimì "Yes, they call me Mimì"), embroidering flowers and waiting for spring. Drawn to each other, Mimì and Rodolfo leave for the café (O soave fanciulla "Oh lovely girl"). ACT II. Amid shouts of street hawkers, Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet near the Café Momus and introduces her to his friends. They all sit and order supper. A toy vendor, Parpignol, passes by, besieged by children. Marcello's former lover, Musetta, enters on the arm of the elderly, wealthy Alcindoro. Trying to regain the painter's attention, she sings a waltz about her popularity (Quando me’n vo “When I walk out”). Complaining that her shoe pinches, Musetta sends Alcindoro to fetch a new pair, then falls into Marcello's arms. The Bohemians leave Alcindoro to face the bill when he returns. ACT III. At dawn on the snowy outskirts of Paris, a Customs Officer admits farm women to the city. Musetta and revelers are heard inside a tavern. Soon Mimì walks by, searching for the place where the reunited Marcello and Musetta now live. When the painter emerges, she pours out her distress over Rodolfo's incessant jealousy (Mimì! . . . Speravo di trovarvi qui). It is best they part, she says. Rodolfo, who has been asleep in the tavern, is heard, and Mimì hides; Marcello thinks she has left. The poet tells Marcello he wants to separate from his fickle sweetheart. Pressed further, he breaks down, saying Mimì is dying; her ill health can only worsen in the poverty they share. Overcome, Mimì stumbles forward to bid her lover farewell (Addio . . . D'onde lieta uscì al tuo grido) as Marcello runs back into the tavern to investigate Musetta's raucous laughter. While Mimì and Rodolfo recall their happiness, Musetta quarrels with Marcello (Dunque è proprio finite). The painter and his mistress part in fury, but Mimì and Rodolfo decide to stay together until spring. ACT IV. Some months later, Rodolfo and Marcello lament their loneliness in the garret (O Mimì, tu più non torni). Colline and Schaunard bring a meager meal. The four stage a dance, which turns into a mock fight. The merrymaking is ended when Musetta bursts in, saying Mimì is downstairs, too weak to climb up. As Rodolfo runs to her, Musetta tells how Mimì has begged to be taken to her lover to die. While Mimì is made comfortable, Marcello goes with Musetta to sell her earrings for medicine, and Colline leaves to pawn his cherished overcoat (Vecchia zimarra "Old coat"). Alone, Mimì and Rodolfo recall their first days together (Sono andati? "Have they gone?"), but she is seized with coughing. When the others return, Musetta gives Mimì a muff to warm her hands and prays for her life. Mimì dies quietly (Dorme? . . . Riposa), and when Schaunard discovers she is dead, Rodolfo runs to her side, calling her name. -Courtesy of Opera News We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Music by Benjamin BrittenLibretto by William Plomer • JANUARY 24, 27, 30, FEB. 1, 2026 Flow with fate.A woman driven mad by the mystery of her lost son learns of her boy’s unfortunate fate from a chance encounter with a Ferryman while crossing a river.Based on the Japanese Noh play Sumidigawa River, Curlew River retells this story as a Christian parable. Written in the style of monastic plain song and laden with musical symbolism, this piece artfully melds theatrical simplicity with ecumenical grandeur.In keeping with these themes and this opera’s history, Curlew River will be staged at Calvary Episcopal Church in Shadyside. Antony Walker conducts; Dana Kinney directs. Where: Calvary Episcopal Church, Shadyside When: The Ferryman: Erik Nordstrom* The Madwoman: Logan Wagner* The Abbot: Matthew Soibelman* The Traveler: Yazid Gray** Conductor: Antony Walker Stage Director: Dana Kinney* + Pittsburgh Opera debut* Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist** Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Alumnus The scene is set in a church by a Fenland river in early medieval times. A group of monks, acolytes, and lay brethren process in with their Abbot, intoning the plain-chant “Te lucis ante terminum.” The lay brothers go to their instruments and the Abbot announces the performance of a mystery showing how a sign of God’s grace was given. The monks who are to play the Madwoman, the Traveller, and the Ferryman are ceremonially costumed. The Madwoman and the Traveller leave the acting area. The Ferryman, whose duty it is to ferry pilgrims across the Curlew River, steps forward. Today is the day when they come to visit a grave on the other bank which is revered as a shrine. There was a burial there a year ago, and the folk believe it can heal the sick. The Traveller approaches. He has been long on the road and he begs for a place on the ferry, which the Ferryman grants. The Madwoman’s cries are heard in the distance as she sings about curlews, lambs, and crows. When she appears, her confused singing includes the mention of her child, and the pilgrims listen to her in amazement. She tells how her son was seized by a stranger, and how she has lost her mind in despair. She begs to get into the boat, but the Ferryman refuses, alarmed by her strange story. Eventually the Traveller, the Abbot, and the pilgrims persuade the Ferryman to allow her on board, and a sail is hoisted. As the ferry crosses to the other bank, the Ferryman tells how a year before a Heathen man came and left behind a boy who had been ill-treated and was very weak. The boy was able to say he head been stolen from his mother before dying with a prayer on his lips. He was buried nearby. The ferry has reached the bank and the sail is lowered. All go ashore to visit the boy’s tomb except the Madwoman. The Ferryman impatiently tels the Madwoman to be on her way, until her questions reveal that she is his mother and this was the boy she lost. She leads the lamentation, in which all join, her prayers mingling with images of birds and flight. A child’s voice is heard and the Spirit of the Child appears above the tomb. He blesses his mother with the promise that they will meet in Heaven. The Madwoman, the Ferryman, and the Traveller resume their monks’ habits and all recss chanting the “Te lucis.” – Hugh Macdonald, Mark Morris Dance Group We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Music by Giuseppe VerdiLibretto adapted by Arrigo Boito from the play The Merry Wives of Windsor and scenesfrom Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2, by William Shakespeare • APRIL 28, MAY 1, 3, 2026 Laugh last, laugh best. Beloved buffoon Sir John Falstaff has fallen on hard times. But being a ladies’ man (or so he’d like to think), he drunkenly schemes to cash in on his wit and charm by wooing the wealthy wives of Windsor, Alice Ford and Meg Page. However, when these women uncover that he has sent them both identical love letters, they hatch a plan of their own to teach Falstaff a lesson he won’t soon forget! The music matches the merriment and mischief of this madcap romp.

Dr. Caius bursts into Sir John Falstaff’s room in the Garter Inn, accusing him of unseemly behavior the previous night. He further accuses Falstaff’s two henchmen, Bardolph and Pistol, of having robbed him while he was drunk. Unable to obtain reparations, Dr. Caius leaves in a fury. Falstaff contemplates the large bill he has run up at the inn. He informs Bardolph and Pistol that in order to repair his finances he plans to seduce Alice Ford and Meg Page, both wives of prosperous Windsor citizens. When Bardolph and Pistol refuse to deliver the letters Falstaff has written to the two ladies, Falstaff instructs a page to do so instead. He then ridicules Bardolph and Pistol’s newly discovered sense of honor, before throwing them out of his room. The Garter Inn. Alice Ford and Meg Page laugh over the identical love letters they have received from Sir John Falstaff. They share their amusement with Alice’s daughter Nannetta, and with their friend Mistress Quickly. Ford arrives, followed by four men all proffering advice: Dr. Caius, whom Ford favors as Nannetta’s future husband; Bardolph and Pistol, who are now seeking advantageous employment from Ford; and Fenton, who is in love with Ford’s daughter Nannetta. When Ford learns of Falstaff’s plan to seduce his wife, he immediately becomes jealous. While Alice and Meg plan how to take revenge on their importunate suitor, Ford decides to disguise himself in order to pay a visit to Falstaff. Unnoticed in the midst of all the commotion, Nannetta and Fenton manage to steal a few precious moments together. ACT II The Garter Inn. Feigning penitence, Bardolph and Pistol rejoin Falstaff’s service. They show in Mistress Quickly, who informs Falstaff that both Alice and Meg are madly in love with him. She explains that it will be easier to seduce Alice, since her husband is out of the house every afternoon, between two and three. Falstaff joyously anticipates his seduction of Alice. Bardolph now announces that a “Mister Brook” (Ford in disguise) wishes to speak to Falstaff. To Falstaff’s surprise, “Brook” offers him wine and money if he will seduce Alice Ford, explaining that he has long been in love with the lady, but to no avail. If she were to be seduced by the more experienced Falstaff, she might then be more likely to fall a second time and accept “Brook.” Falstaff agrees to the plan, telling his surprised new friend that he already has a rendezvous with Alice that very afternoon. As Falstaff leaves to prepare himself, Ford gives way to jealous rage. When Falstaff returns, dressed in his best clothes, the two men exchange compliments before leaving together. Ford’s house. Mistress Quickly, Alice and Meg are preparing for Falstaff’s visit. Nannetta tearfully tells her mother that her father insists on her marrying Dr. Caius, but Alice tells her daughter not to worry. Falstaff arrives and begins his seduction of Alice, nostalgically boasting of his aristocratic youth as page to the Duke of Norfolk. As Falstaff becomes more amorous, Meg Page interrupts the tête-à-tête, as planned, to announce (in jest) that Ford is approaching. But just at that point Mistress Quickly suddenly returns in a panic to inform Alice that Ford really is on his way, and in a jealous temper. As Ford rushes in with a group of townsfolk, the terrified Falstaff seeks a hiding place, eventually ending up in a large laundry basket. Fenton and Nannetta also hide. Ford and the other men ransack the house. Hearing the sound of kissing, Ford is convinced that he has found his wife and her lover Falstaff together, but is furious to discover Nannetta and Fenton instead. While Ford argues with Fenton, Alice instructs her servants to empty the laundry basket out of the window. To general hilarity, Falstaff is thrown into the River Thames. ACT III Outside the Garter Inn. A wet and bruised Falstaff laments the wickedness of the world, but soon cheers up with a glass of mulled wine. Mistress Quickly persuades him that Alice was innocent of the unfortunate incident at Ford’s house. To prove that Alice still loves him, she proposes a new rendezvous that night in Windsor Great Park. In a letter that Quickly gives to Falstaff, Alice asks the knight to appear at midnight, disguised as the Black Huntsman. Ford, Nannetta, Meg, and Alice prepare the second part of their plot: Nannetta will be Queen of the Fairies and the others, also in disguise, will help to continue Falstaff’s punishment. Ford secretly promises Caius that he will marry Nannetta that evening. Mistress Quickly overhears them. Windsor Great Park. As Fenton and Nannetta are reunited, Alice explains her plan to trick Ford into marrying them. They all hide as Falstaff approaches. On the stroke of midnight, Alice appears. She declares her love for Falstaff, but suddenly runs away, saying that she hears spirits approaching. Nannetta, disguised as the Queen of the Fairies, summons her followers who attack the terrified Falstaff, pinching and poking him until he promises to give up his dissolute ways. In the midst of the assault Falstaff suddenly recognizes Bardolph, and realizes that he has been tricked. While Ford explains that he was “Brook,” Quickly scolds Falstaff for his attempts at seducing two younger, virtuous women. Falstaff accepts that he has been made a figure of fun, but points out that he remains the real source of wit in others. Dr. Caius now comes forward with a figure in white. They are to be married by Ford. Alice brings forward another couple, who also receive Ford’s blessing. When the brides remove their veils it is revealed that Ford has just married Fenton to Nannetta, and Dr. Caius to Bardolph. With everyone now laughing at his expense, Ford has no choice but to forgive the lovers and bless their marriage. Before sitting down to a wedding supper with Sir John Falstaff, the entire company agrees that the whole world may be nothing but a jest filled with jesters, but he who laughs last, laughs best. — Metropolitan Opera We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

At the height of the McCarthy era, naive college graduate Timothy Laughlin comes to Washington eager to join the crusade against communism. But a chance encounter with a handsome State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job—and his first relationship with a man. Under the threat of increased government scrutiny, this complicated and clandestine affair will put both men’s loyalties and convictions to the ultimate test. As the poisonous political climate pollutes their relationship, love becomes a casualty of what it takes to “play the game” in Washington. Based on Thomas Mallon’s 2007 gut-wrenching novel, Fellow Travelers was praised as “a near-perfect example of fast-flowing musical drama” by The New York Times and is already widely considered a contemporary classic.

Pinkerton enters his apartment and dons a VR headset to escape into a fantasy. Within moments, he rejoins a game which transports him to Nagasaki, where he embodies his avatar as a U.S. Navy lieutenant. He inspects a house that he will occupy with his young bride, Cio-Cio- San (a.k.a. Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the U.S. Consul, arrives, and Pinkerton shares his vision of a sailor in search of pleasure and the beautiful Japanese girl who has captivated him. Sharpless tries to warn him of this view, but Pinkerton laughs, toasting the American girl who will someday be his “real” wife. Butterfly, her colleagues, and family arrive for the wedding. She tells Pinkerton that since her father’s death, she now earns her living as a geisha. She also has secretly converted to Christianity. The Imperial Commissioner performs the marriage ceremony. Then, Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze, bursts in. He curses her, inciting the crowd. Protecting Butterfly, Pinkerton orders the guests away. Butterfly weeps and her new husband consoles her. As night falls in this pleasure fantasy, the lovers share a moonlit duet. Three years later, modern-day Pinkerton and his American wife have grown distant. His only means of escape is through gaming, where he can manipulate his Japanese bride’s future. In the virtual world, Cio-Cio-San patiently waits for him. Her servant Suzuki implores the gods for aid, but Butterfly bids her to have faith—one day, Pinkerton will return and embrace his wife again. Sharpless enters with a letter telling of Pinkerton’s marriage to an American. Before he can tell Butterfly, Goro interrupts along with a suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San refuses his marriage proposal. She brings forth her young son, Trouble, and insists that as soon as Pinkerton knows of him, he will return. If not, she would rather die. A cannon roars from the harbor, and Butterfly discovers Pinkerton’s ship coming into port. She and Suzuki strew the house with blossoms. As evening falls, she prepares to keep vigil through the night. Modern-day Pinkerton turns off the game and goes to bed. In the middle of the night, the game turns on, luring him back to play the next level, where he chooses how he will impact Butterfly’s destiny. Pinkerton chooses an American wife avatar, Kate. As the level continues, Butterfly still waits, though Suzuki persuades her to rest. Soon, Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate arrive. Suzuki realizes who the woman is and reluctantly agrees to inform Butterfly. Pinkerton, now aware of Butterfly’s devotion, bids an anguished farewell and rushes away. Cio-Cio-San hurries in expecting to find her husband, and instead finds Kate. She instantly guesses the truth and touchingly wishes Kate happiness. She says that Pinkerton may have his son if he will return for him. Butterfly orders Suzuki and Trouble away. She has no choice but to escape this nightmare, and she pulls out the dagger with which her father committed suicide. As she raises the blade to her throat, Trouble appears. Cio-Cio-San drops the knife and embraces him. She then blindfolds him, takes the dagger, and stabs herself. As the fantasy dies, Pinkerton desperately tries to hold onto his creation, Butterfly.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Music by Jennifer HigdonLibretto by Jerre Dye • APRIL 26, 29, MAY 2, 3, 4, 2025 A family portraitWhen Mona finds a mysterious suitcase filled with stolen masterpieces, she must grapple with a choice to save these priceless paintings or save her son—the thief. Burning the paintings would destroy the evidence of her son’s crime, but one of the paintings—Lucien Freud’s “Woman With Eyes Closed”—looks just like her own mother, a painter who died when Mona was still young. The uncanny resemblance unlocks long-buried memories that fuel the fires of three different possible endings.This world premiere opera from award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon (Cold Mountain) is inspired by a real-life art heist, and confronts the question “what is the true value of a work of art?” This is an opera that needs to be seen at least twice; each night of the production has the possibility of a completely new ending!Commissioned by Opera Philadelphia.

The police, the media, and the museum’s curator are desperate to find the culprit. In hopes of avoiding police detection, the thief (Thomas) has carelessly stuffed the stolen masterworks in a suitcase and abandoned them with his unsuspecting his Mother, Mona. In her son’s absence, the reclusive Mona investigates the contents of the suitcase discovering both the severity of her son’s crime as well as the innate beauty of each masterpiece. One painting in particular (Lucian Freud’s WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED) awakens something deep inside Mona, shaking her to the very core. The painting bears astriking resemblance to Mona’s Mother, an amateur artist who died when Mona was child. The circumstances surrounding her Mother’s death have reverberated throughout Mona’s life. The police investigation continues to escalate, bringing an Inspector to Mona’s front door. Though Mona lies to the Inspector, successfully sending him on his way, she also knows that her flimsy deception is merely a temporary fix. The police already have evidence connecting Thomas to the crime. It’s a matter of time before he is apprehended. Mona must act quickly. Night falls. Mona sleeps. As she dreams, the Freud painting comes to life. Inside a liminal state, Mona and her Mother briefly reunite. Inside this memory, the two women examine the past. They navigate the pain and compromise of a life half-lived, a life starved for color, expression, and connection. Together, they unearth the past trauma that continues to define Mona’s future. With the dawn comes many burning questions: Can Mona save her son, save herself and save these priceless paintings while simultaneously preserving the memory of her Mother? WOMAN WITH EYES CLOSED is a new opera about creation, destruction and the art of letting go. - courtesy of the creators We want you to have the best experience possible at our performances!

Today, Forever, our 80th Anniversary Campaign, honors their foresight and legacy as we prepare for our next 80 years. Pittsburgh Opera has a significant record of excellence, authenticity, and passion. The superb quality of our on-stage productions, Resident Artists program, and community engagement initiatives is recognized internationally. We are among the very few opera companies that owns our facilities for rehearsal, costumes, and administration. Our building was built in 1869 as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory, which perfectly illustrates Pittsburgh Opera’s deep and resonant connection to our region and our past. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Pittsburgh Opera strives for accessibility in its performances, performance spaces, communications, and at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. We have also been a leader in offering accessibility services, such as Audio Commentary and Braille program books, at performances. Pittsburgh Opera is committed to including all staff, patrons, and volunteers in all performances and programs. We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions. We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers. We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company. All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage (unless otherwise noted). These are sometimes referred to as "OpTrans". Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory. Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes. A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the "pre-show". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the "play-by-play". Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling , ext. 213. Tickets are $14.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby. Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) transmit and/or amplify the sound of a production for anyone with or without a hearing aid. The Benedum Center has two systems for Assistive Listening: an Infrared system and an Inductive Loop system. Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory have radio systems for broadcasting audio description. These Assistive Listening Devices with radio receivers are set to the frequency of the broadcast. After patrons turn the radio on, they can adjust the volume. Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Requests for sign language interpreters must be received at least two weeks prior to the performance, and are subject to the availability of an interpreter. To request an ASL interpreter at a Pittsburgh Opera performance, please email us or call x216 for details. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call the Benedum Center directly at . Watch the video below to learn how ASL interpreters enhance the performance for patrons, and why ASL conveys things beyond what our supertitles can do. Video by Abbie Whitehurst Large print and Braille programs are available for every performance and may be obtained in the Guest Services Center at the Benedum Center. For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and at the Bitz Opera Factory, Braille and Large Print programs may be obtained at the Education table in the lobby. Patrons who wish to read study guides in advance of performances may request that their email addresses be added to the Audio Commentary email updates list. Sensory Workshops are held for select productions at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. These workshops examine the story, the music, and the background of the opera. Participants will have a chance to explore the scenery, props, and costumes. Workshops are conducted by the Education Department. Sensory Workshops are free, but reservations should be made by calling , ext. 242. Customers with physical disabilities requiring an extra chair or a wheelchair location will be seated in an aisle space in the George R. White Studio. Since the George R.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room, which will be used exclusively for this service. There are a limited number of spaces available, and pre-registration is required. To register, you (the parent/guardian of the child) will ‘purchase’ a free childcare ticket when you buy your own ticket to the opera. Your order confirmation email will include a link to a registration form, which includes your seating location, information about any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and you must remain in the building during the performance. The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Pittsburgh Opera has worked closely with their partners at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which owns and operates the Benedum Center, and Priya Amin, the founder of on-site childcare provider Flexable, to bring this program to life. Where is the childcare provided? The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room on the second floor, which will be used exclusively for this service. What are the age limits? The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service.

Please use the process shown in the "How to add Childcare to your ticket purchase" section below to add Childcare tickets to your shopping cart while you are purchasing your tickets to see the opera performance. You will receive a 'ticket' for the childcare which the usher will scan when you enter the Benedum just like they'll scan your ticket to the performance. Once I order my childcare ticket, am I done? Not quite. Your order confirmation email will include a link to an online registration form to fill out. This form will ask for information about things such as your seating location, the child's name and age, any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You will need to fill out and submit that form in advance. The form includes a liability waiver, which you can read in the "Liability Waiver" section of this webpage. The parent/guardian must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and remain in the building during the performance. When do I drop off and pick up my child? The Benedum Center opens 1 hour 15 minutes before the performance starts. You may drop your child off anytime after the Benedum opens up until the beginning of the performance. You are welcome to visit your child during intermission if you wish. Children must be picked up within 10 minutes of the performance’s ending. Children may only be released to the person that signed them in to the childcare area. NO EXCEPTIONS. After I drop my kid off, can I duck across the street for a bite to eat before the show starts? No! In fact, double No. The parent/guardian must remain in the building during the performance. Can I bring toys or books or games, or their favorite stuffed animal, for my child to use? Yes, provided you adhere to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Bag Policy and their Prohibited Items policy. Pittsburgh Opera will have a range of age-appropriate activities available for your child to use. Will there be food provided? Parents may feed their children snacks, e.g. during intermission, but the childcare providers will not provide food to the children. Please note that parents must follow the Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts' outside food and beverage policy. What about bathrooms and dirty diapers? Childcare staff will cover diaper changes and/or accompany kids to the bathroom unless the parent requests otherwise. Parents must bring their child's diapers/wipes/pullups. My child takes medication every afternoon. Will you give my child their regular daily medication? No, medications will not be administered by childcare staff.

BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 The rideshare program will let Pittsburgh Opera ticket buyers for Armida and/or Madama Butterfly add $60 of Uber Vouchers to their Pittsburgh Opera ticket purchase, at no extra cost. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Patrons must have an Uber account to redeem the vouchers. The vouchers can be used on the opera’s performance date, for rides that start or end within a half-mile radius of the theater. 1. After selecting the Pittsburgh Opera performance you’d like to see on our online ticketing website opera.culturaldistrict.org and adding it to your cart, click on the “Rideshare Voucher Program” link in the “Add Rideshare” box: (See screenshot examples from last year's inaugural rideshare program at La Traviata below:) 2. Click on the “Get Tickets” link on the Rideshare Voucher Program page: 3. Select the date of your performance – please be sure it matches the performance you are purchasing tickets for: 4. Select “1” from the “How Many Tickets” drop-down menu: You will then see the Rideshare Voucher added to your cart, along with your ticket to the performance. You can then check Check Out as usual. Please note that for the vouchers to work correctly, either your email address or phone number in your CulturalDistrict.org account must match the email address or phone number you use in your Uber account. Uber will ‘match’ you by comparing the email addresses and phone numbers in our recipient lists with their own account records. At least 72 hours prior to your performance, Pittsburgh Opera will add you to our voucher recipient list in our Uber for Business account. You will receive an email from Uber notifying you about the Voucher, which may look like this: Once you accept the voucher through Uber’s direct invitation, the voucher will be added to your Uber account. Then the voucher will automatically be applied to rides that match the voucher criteria. If you spend more than the voucher covers, Uber will charge any overage to your personal payment method. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages, and recipients should make sure that the voucher has started, isn’t expired, and is valid for the time and location. Recipients can always reach out to Uber through in-app support, and a specialized team will help them. Please note that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown below, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. If Uber does charge you anyway, please contact us and we will happily resolve it for you. When can I use the voucher? The voucher will come with specific date and time information; it can only be used during that date and time. The date will be the date of your Pittsburgh Opera performance. Pittsburgh Opera builds in a cushion of several hours before and after the show when the voucher can be used, so that if you want to go to dinner downtown before the show or do something else nearby afterwards, you can. Do I have to be dropped off or picked up at the actual theater? Nope. Your ride must either originate from or finish within a half-mile radius of the theater. If you want to be dropped off at a nearby restaurant, or picked up from a watering hole around the corner a few hours after the show, that’s fine. What if my rides end up costing more than $60? You will be responsible for paying any amounts above $60; Uber will charge your payment method already on file. Recipients must have a personal payment method (excluding vouchers) on file in their Uber account in case of overages. What if my rides end up costing less than $60, can I keep the leftover credit? Sorry, no. The credits can only be used for rides to/from your opera performance. If your ride is less than $60, we recommend you be happy that your whole ride was free. Will Pittsburgh Opera schedule my ride for me? No. Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. We are merely providing funds for you to use. I'm not sure how to use Uber. Should I call Pittsburgh Opera? No. The good people at Uber know much more about setting up and using Uber accounts than we do. We recommend you explore their Support Resources for Uber Riders webpage, or ask your friends or relatives who use Uber. Can I use Lyft instead of Uber? Currently Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program exclusively uses Uber. Can I use some of my voucher for Uber Eats? Pittsburgh Opera’s rideshare voucher program is specifically for rides, not food. I already bought a ticket to the opera – can I add an Uber Voucher now? Rideshare vouchers can only be added to new ticket purchases; the offer is not valid on past ticket purchases. What if I don’t receive my voucher? Please double check that the phone number and email address in your Uber account match the ones in your CulturalDistrict.org account. Please email us within 48 hours of your performance with your name, contact information, and order number and we can verify if you were added as a voucher recipient. I got my voucher, and even though I scheduled my ride to the theater within the specified timeframe, Uber looks like they're making me pay for my ride with my credit/debit card. What's the deal? As we were testing the voucher program, we noticed that when you book your ride, Uber may make you 'select' your personal payment method, like shown here, even though you are using your voucher. We are not sure why they do this. But as long as your ride meets the voucher criteria, they should not actually charge your card unless the ride exceeds the value of your voucher. Patrons are responsible for scheduling their own rides. Pittsburgh Opera does not arrange or deliver the actual rides. Pittsburgh Opera is not responsible for any ride-related issues, e.g. the driver failing to arrive on time; the car gets a flat tire, you’re stuck in traffic and miss the beginning of the performance, etc. A limited number of Uber Vouchers are available for each performance; the offer is valid while supplies last. Rideshare vouchers can be added to new ticket purchases only; offer not valid on past ticket purchases. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under "Details and Resources." Typically first-timers like to start with classics like Madama Butterfly (coming March, 2024) at the Benedum Center. They've got famous and familiar music, fantastic casts, traditional sets and costumes, and, well, that grand-opera grandness that so many people love. You'll understand every word with the English texts projected above the stage. Of course! Opera is fun for the whole family. We have kids who come to our student matinees and then make their parents come back so they can see the show again. The main thing is that your child should be able to sit quietly for long periods of time. Third or fourth graders are usually fine, but parents are the best judge. Pittsburgh Opera sells tickets for kids and teens ages 6-18 for half-price, to make it easier for you to expose them to this wonderful art form. Some operas – OK, most operas – have adult themes. Murder, revenge, lust – all that stuff that grown-ups find so interesting. Kids do best if you prepare them in advance. Tell them the story of the opera, play some of the music, or watch a few videos on YouTube. Have your little Warhols and Cassatts draw pictures of their favorite characters or imagine what the set might be like. Be creative! A little common courtesy is all you need. It probably bothers you when people talk and rattle their candy wrappers at the movies, or talk on their phones, or show up late, or get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the show. If something is considered poor form at the movies, it's probably poor form at the opera too. If you’re not sure when to clap, just wait until everybody else does. If you really like what you hear, yell, “Bravo!” Or just cheer! Yes! Our mainstage productions are at the Benedum Center. Our 2023-24 season features The Barber of Seville, The Flying Dutchman, and La Traviata at the Benedum Center live and large on the grand stage. Parking near the Benedum CenterThe are several parking garages within a few blocks of the Benedum Center. You can get real-time parking availability at ParkPGH.

Try the free Pre-Opera Talks with Kristin Gatch one hour before every curtain at Benedum Center and CAPA Theater performances.

If you have redeemed your Pass for tickets whose normal face values totals more than you've paid so far for your Pass, then Pittsburgh Opera reserves the right to charge you for the difference. For example, if you buy a Pass, immediately redeem it for a ticket, and then after the performance you cancel your Pass, we will charge you the difference between the regular ticket price and the $20 you paid for your Pass. The Opus Pass is a great value, we just want to make sure folks don't try to game the system - not that you would ever do that of course!

If you need an accessible seat, e.g. for a wheelchair, please let us know. Pittsburgh Opera will do our best to honor specific seating requests. But please know that specific seat assignments are not guaranteed, and are subject to availability. Where do I pick up my tickets? At Will Call. Please remember to bring photo ID. What if a performance is already sold out? If a performance is already sold out when a Passholder tries to redeem their Pass for a ticket, they will have the option of being placed on the Wait List, and will be eligible to use tickets released by other patrons. What if I end up not being able to attend a performance I redeemed my Pass for? We understand that unexpected circumstances may prevent you from attending a performance which you've redeemed your Pass for. If that happens, please let us know at least one hour prior to the performance so that we can release your ticket. Passholders who repeatedly request tickets and do not use them without notifying us in advance may have their Pass revoked at the discretion of Pittsburgh Opera. Can I give my Opus Pass to someone else when I'm not using it? No. Pittsburgh Opera Opus Passes are non-transferable. You must show Photo ID when picking up your tickets. I normally buy two tickets to the opera - one for me and one for my partner or friend. Do we each need our own Opus Pass if we want to go to the same performances together? It depends. I want to buy two Opus Passes and bring a different friend to each performance. Can I? No. Households with more than one Opus Pass will need to assign a name to each Pass. However, Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any given performance at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price, and your seats will be together. Can I buy extra tickets when I redeem my Pass for a performance? Yes! Passholders can purchase additional tickets to any performance, subject to availability, at a 10% discount over the regular single ticket price. Your seats will be together. I’d like to order an Opus Pass for a friend as a gift. Can I? Yes! Please call us at ext. 3 and we will be happy to help you. Can I order a bunch of tickets with my Opus Pass and then turn around and sell them? No! Tickets reserved through the Opus Pass are intended for use by the Passholder, and may not be resold. Passholders found to have violated this policy are subject to having their Passes revoked without refund. Is my Opus Pass good for Pittsburgh Opera's galas or other paid events? Your Pittsburgh Opera Opus Pass is good for all our staged operas. It does not include admission to our galas (the Diamond Horseshoe Ball and Maecenas) or paid special events such as our annual Fashion Show - tickets for those must be purchased separately. I am a Pittsburgh Opera subscriber who wants to keep my seats. Can I get an Opus Pass? Yes! You can get our Opus Pass Subscription Add On for just an extra $5 a month. rs who elect the Add On will keep their existing seats for their primary performance, but aren’t guaranteed those same seats for the performances seen with their Opus Pass. The Opus Pass Subscription Add On is a great way to see your favorites more than once and to check out different locations in the theater for a very low price. Can I get the Opus Pass Subscription Add On if I modify my subscription? If you maintain your 2023-24 subscription package for 2024-25, or if you add an extra opera to your package or upgrade your seating zone, you can add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. But if you 'downgrade', for example go from a 2023-24 Quartet to a 2024-25 Duet package, you cannot add the Opus Pass Subscription Add On. Do I pay for my Opus Pass Add On upfront, or am I billed monthly? rs who select a Opus Pass Add On will have the $60 annual cost for their Pass added to their order total, which can be paid all at once or in installments. Can I still get an Opus Pass Add On if I subscribe after the 2024-25 season is underway? Yes. Your Opus Pass Add On would be valid for the remainder of the 2024-25 season. We would charge you $5/month for the remaining months of the season, i.e. a pro-rated portion of the $60 annual cost. If I have to cancel my Subscription, what happens to my Opus Pass Add On? If a subscriber cancels their subscription, their Opus Pass Add On will be canceled too. They will be eligible to purchase a Opus Pass at the regular price of $20/month. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. ©2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA

Pittsburgh Opera's official online ticketing site homepage is opera.culturaldistrict.org, which we operate in partnership with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's online ticketing site trustarts.org.

Pittsburgh Opera cannot give you a refund if you have to cancel, since you did not buy the ticket from us. Pittsburgh Opera cannot contact you with crucial information on show cancellations, time changes, road closures or traffic updates, upcoming shows or other useful information. Tickets purchased from unofficial sources are done so at a risk. By purchasing only from opera.culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org you are assured that the ticket you receive is valid and is being sold to you at current face value.

Pittsburgh Restaurant Week is a celebration of restaurants and dining in the steel city. Started in 2012, it’s been an annual tradition to host a winter edition in January and summer edition in August. The winter edition focuses of celebrating “New Dishes for the New Year” while the summer edition features dishes taking advantage of the local produce and harvests with lighter fare. In order to participate in restaurant week, the restaurant is expected to create a limited-time small menu that is offered for dine-in guests during the dinner meals between the dates of the celebration alongside the restaurant’s normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement. See more details on pricing below. Restaurant registration is accepted on a rolling basis up until the celebration. A restaurant must complete the online registration form and submit timely payment to appear on the listing of restaurants and on the participating restaurant map. The registration form will ask for the anticipated pricing structure (multi-course vs special entrees, but the exact pricing structure is NOT locked in until menu is provided. On the restaurant listing page, the restaurant appears at the bottom of the page until the menu is received. Once the limited-time menu has been determined, upload the special menu through the website to receive the full benefit of the celebration. It is recommended the menu is provided as text-only and not embedded in a prepared graphic. Once the menu is provided, it will be posted to the restaurant’s profile. Menus submitted before the posted deadline will be formatted and shared through Pittsburgh Restaurant Week’s social media platforms. Menus provided after the deadline will be posted to the website but will forfeit the benefit of the social media versions being created. With such a wide variety of establishments participating, a one-size-fits all pricing model doesn’t make sense, so Pittsburgh Restaurant Week has themed pricing of “24-cents” for 2024. All special menus should follow that pricing model. Common pricing options include: Restaurant Owners: Sign-up to receive exclusive restaurant owner alerts:

This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs. The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania. In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years. Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Center’s collections. The Historical Society brought our region’s history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the region’s 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the region’s bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the region’s 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today. Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members’ homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburgh’s Strip District. With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions. Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvania’s Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburgh’s Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, : A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museum’s artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage. As Pittsburgh’s “people museum,” the History Center preserves and interprets the history of Western Pennsylvanians through six floors of interactive exhibitions that feature iconic artifacts like the TV set from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the world’s oldest jeep. The Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located on the History Center’s second and third floors, celebrates the unsurpassed sports legacy of the City of Champions. From football to baseball and hockey to golf, the Sports Museum highlights the region’s passion for amateur and professional sports. The Fort Pitt Museum, located in historic Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, is a two-floor, 12,000-square-foot museum that presents the story of Western Pennsylvania’s essential role during the French & Indian War, the American Revolution, and as the birthplace of Pittsburgh. Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America, is located in Avella, Washington County, Pa. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, a National Historic Landmark, features 19,000-year-old evidence of the region’s earliest inhabitants under a massive rock overhang. In addition to the Rockshelter, the site is also home to three outdoor historic areas, including a 16th century Indian village, 18th century Frontier Trading Post, and 19th century village that help visitors experience life over the past 500 years. More than 250 years of our region’s history can be found at the Thomas and Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Founded in 1879, the Library & Archives’ collections are accessible to researchers, students, and the general public. The History Center recently earned the coveted 4-star rating from Charity Navigator for sound fiscal management and commitment to accountability and transparency, so you can be confident that your donation is going to a great place. © 2025 Heinz History Center

Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History Model of the Rodman Process pioneered at the Fort Pitt Foundry, c. 1864 (base added in 1878) The first gun built using the Rodman hollow casting process was made at the Fort Pitt Foundry in the 1850s. In 1860, the War Department commissioned Rodman to build the world’s first 15-inch cannon. By 1864, Rodman had also supervised the fabrication of a massive 20-inch gun. This model depicts the specialized intricate casting apparatus used in making the first 20-inch Rodman, which required nearly 80 tons of molten iron poured from three furnaces. A complex four-piece mold was required to shape the cannon, which was cast in an upright position. The completed 20-inch gun barrel, one of six made at the Fort Pitt Foundry, weighed 117,000 pounds. This model educated West Point Military Academy cadets on the casting techniques pioneered in Pittsburgh. Courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History KDKA transmitter, c. 1921 In the days when there were few regulations for radios, Frank Conrad, a Westinghouse engineer, built a makeshift studio in his garage and played records over the airwaves. His supervisor at Westinghouse, Harry P. Davis saw Conrad’s hobby as a great way to sell more radios, and they applied for the first commercial radio license. On October 27, 1920, they received the call letters KDKA and set up a small studio in Westinghouse’s East Pittsburgh Works. On November 2, KDKA broadcast the election results between Harding and Cox, credited as the first commercial radio broadcast.

The Heinz History Center actively seeks collections and archival materials related to the history of Western Pennsylvania and the experiences of its people, both past and present. If you have objects, photographs, artwork, digital material, or documents that you believe would be of potential interest to our collection, we would like to hear from you. To start the donation process, please tell us about your materials by filling out an Collection Donation Form. The more information provided about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania, the easier it is for our Collections Committee to assess. An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is also appreciated. Donate to the Collection For additional questions or information, please email [email protected]. Please use on our online form to offer historic materials. Please do not bring materials to the History Center without an appointment. Tell us anything you know about the history of the materials and their connection to Western Pennsylvania. For example, you might explain who owned them and when or how they were used or why they were produced. An attached image and inventory of the material you wish to donate is appreciated. The material will then be assessed by our Collections Committee and you will be notified of their decision. Materials that document the lives of Western Pennsylvanians and the history of the region up to and including the present. Historic materials can take many forms, such as personal letters, business records, uniforms, tools, local souvenirs, paintings of Western Pennsylvania, published books or family scrapbooks, hand-made quilts, and Pittsburgh manufactured products. The most important criterion for donation is that the materials say something about this region. It is important to provide as much detail as you can about the articles you wish to donate, this will help the Collections Committee make a more informed decision. We cannot accept everything. Organizing, cataloging, and preserving historical materials for the future takes so much space, time, and money, that donations must be selected very carefully. Staff review each offer and compare it with what we already have in the collection, they assess its condition and determine what it tells us about life in Western Pennsylvania. Normally, objects and artwork need to be seen before a decision can be made. Unless we designate your materials for a specific exhibit, they will not be put on display immediately. What you see at the History Center is only a very small part of the collections. That is because we have limited gallery space and because long-term display can have negative effects on preservation. The rest are carefully catalogued and stored in a temperature controlled environment so that they will be available for future exhibits at the History Center, for loan to other museums, or for research and reference for generations to come. Please do nothing to the items. We prefer to see them in their original condition. Do not clean, repaint, refinish, or “spruce up” historical materials before giving them to us. Please provide as much related historical information as possible. For example, if you plan to offer your grandfather’s report card, you might also offer photographs of him as a student, samples of his school papers and the cap he wore at school. If you have photographs it is helpful to make copies and identify the people and locations in the images. Documents, photographs and published materials are available for research and reference in the Detre Library & Archives at the History Center during regular hours. Requests to see artwork and objects should be made to the collections manager at . Please give our curators and archivists at least two weeks advance notice. Yes. The donor is responsible for determining and documenting the value of a donation. Staff at the History Center cannot appraise materials. They can give you a list of certified appraisers. Materials are not accepted on long term loan, nor can agreements be made to return materials to heirs. Occasionally, short term loans for specific exhibits are accepted. The Deed of Gift, signed by every donor, gives the History Center clear ownership of the materials. The History Center accepts responsibility for preserving each donation for generations to come. Yes. Please contact us and let us know of the planned bequest. We appreciate having the opportunity to learn the story behind the materials. We can also explain in further detail the appropriate phrasing for your documents. Please note, bequests must meet collections requirements. Each item or collection is different, but factors that contribute to the decision include, but are not limited to, its historical or cultural significance to the Western Pennsylvania region, physical condition, whether or not the museum already owns a similar item or copy, and its ownership history. With limited space and resources, our interest is in building the collection where gaps exist or in area of particular interest. In general, we are not interested in adding items that duplicate those already in the collection. You can search the Library & Archives holdings here. Each item or collection that is donated is assigned a unique number and entered into the online catalog. Depending on the size of a collection, more work might need to be done prior to it being accessible to the public. This includes, but limited to, organizing, re-housing materials in acid-free folders, addressing minor preservation needs, and writing a finding aid to the collection. Very rarely does the Detre Library & Archives purchase a collection. On these occasions, we cannot suggest or set a purchase price. This must be set by the seller. For assistance in identifying historical materials or learning more about them, please email [email protected]. While we do not provide appraisals, our team can suggest ways to locate certified appraisers. © 2025 Heinz History Center

You have exceeded the time limit and your seats have been released. Manfred Honeck has firmly established himself as one of the world’s leading conductors, whose distinctive and revelatory interpretations receive great international acclaim. As Music Director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where his contract runs through the 2027-2028 season, he has entered his 17th season. Celebrated at home and abroad, he and the orchestra continue to serve as cultural ambassadors for the city of Pittsburgh. Guest appearances include Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in New York, as well as the major venues of Europe and leading festivals such as the BBC Proms, Salzburg Festival, Musikfest Berlin, Lucerne Festival, Rheingau Music Festival, Beethovenfest Bonn, and Grafenegg Festival. In summer 2024, he leads the Pittsburgh Symphony in a nine-city European Festivals Tour, starting with their appearance as the only American orchestra at the prestigious Salzburg Festival and concluding at Vienna Konzerthaus. Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY® nominations, and he and the orchestra won the GRAMMY® for "Best Orchestral Performance" in 2018. The most recent recording, Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, paired with Resurrexit by Mason Bates, was released in July 2024 to great critical acclaim. Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra, following decades of close collaboration. Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss, Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, leading a revival of Mozart’s Idomeneo. Beyond the podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites, including Janáček’s Jenůfa, Strauss’s Elektra, Dvořák’s Rusalka as well as Puccini's Turandot which he regularly performs around the globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’s Salome, was premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023. As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States, he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty years. In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on the music of this composer. Manfred Honeck holds honorary doctorates from several universities in the United States and was awarded the honorary title of Professor by the Austrian Federal President. In 2018, the jury of the International Classical Music Awards declared him "Artist of the Year". Please do not shorten or revise without permission of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.

Entrance Security Policy All audience members are required to enter through state-of-the-art scanning equipment, designed both to enhance security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There will be no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Bag and Personal Belongings Policy Heinz Hall reserves the right to search any bags entering the facility. Oversized bags must fit comfortably under a seat to ensure the safety of patrons entering or exiting seats and aisles. Bags failing to meet these requirements must be checked at which time a search will be conducted by security or returned to your vehicle. You are encouraged to leave personal computers and iPads at home, as they are required to be turned off during performances. Costume Policy Heinz Hall does not permit masks of any kind or facsimiles of weapons that would make other guests feel uncomfortable or detract from the concert experience. Guests are welcome to attend certain programs (such as, The Music of Harry Potter or The Music of Star Wars) in costume. What exactly is the Heinz Hall “free-flow” screening system? In use at hundreds of sites worldwide including Lincoln Center, Oakland (CA) Airport and LL Bean, the Heinz Hall screening system uses “smart” technology to enhance visitor security and convenience. Heinz Hall selected a “free-flow” system which allows patrons to simply walk through unimpeded. There is no need to remove coats or bags; cell phones and keys can remain in your pockets. Patrons using wheelchairs and mobility devices will be directed to enter via a door adjacent to the screening equipment where alternative screening will occur. Patrons with children in strollers may enter through the screening equipment. Artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What if I don't want to go through the scanner? An alternative entry door will be available that will have wanding and bag check. Is the scanner safe for medical devices and pregnant women? The system is safe to go through with medical devices and for pregnant women. However, on request, you may use the alternative entry door that will have wanding and bag check. Is screening the the same at every concert or event? As is the case now, artists and promoters may require additional security procedures for their performances. What makes the system "smart" and what will you do with the video images? The screening equipment uses technology to screen for threats. The images captured by the system for alarm purposes are only captured briefly; they are not retained by Heinz Hall. There is no official dress code for events in Heinz Hall. Many patrons wear business attire, and many prefer to be more casual. Wear whatever makes you feel more comfortable.

Inspired by Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated), KEA — an acclaimed artist celebrated for her soulful voice, evocative storytelling, and magnetic stage presence — weaves together music, poetry, and visual elements to reflect on the legacy of racial history in America. Joined by her talented duo of musicians on drums and guitar, the program features iconic African-American songs, original verse, and rhythmic percussion, bridging past and present in a profound meditation on resilience, heritage, and justice. Ticket price includes exhibition admission, a glass of wine (21+), and after the performance meet-and-greet with the musicians. Advance registration and pre-payment required. KEA — vocals Gary Kalinoski — guitar Kai Ballard — percussion Raised in Pittsburgh to a singer/guitarist father and a violinist mother, KEA has had an intimate relationship with music all her life. With her love for literature, her first writings were in the realm of poetry. KEA's love for singing blossomed following vocal training from Elayne Kitay and the local Jazz Workshop. KEA was always sensitive and deeply affected by the ebb and flow of personal relationships — the sweet beginnings, the steamy evolutions, the work put in to sustain them, and all too often, the endings. Her insights became poems and later songs, each helping her shape her unique outlet of soul with a touch of jazz. A debut single, "iLove You," came to her one inspirational night in 2015 when she sat down to write a poem-like lullaby for one of her daughters. She later turned that poem into a song about an older daughter battling kidney hydro-nephrosis since birth. When the opportunity presented itself, KEA recorded "iLove You" and independently released it to the world on July 28, 2017, where it garnered profound international support on the BBC and Radiovolna and peaked at on four U.K. Soul charts. smoothjazz.com even chose it as 'Song of the Month' by influential music site SoulTracks. To keep up the momentum, KEA had a beautiful video shot in high definition 4K. From the pages of her life struggles, the storyline was the years that KEA placed romance on the backburner to focus on her daughter's health. The “iLove You” video was directed and edited by Deon Smalley (Smalley Films), and KEA, who also cast the clip and handled the production and costume design. It was vital to KEA for the key locations around Pittsburgh to serve as backdrops, in-cluding Andrew Carnegie Free Library and Music Hall, Airbnb Historic Day House, and Dorsey’s Records shop. Most poignantly, the video starred KEA and her children Au-hneyah (6) and Alyssa (16) (playing one child over ten years), solidifying the intimate single-parent family portrait of unshakable love between a mother and daughter. KEA returned with her second single. “Not My Friend,” a smooth, engaging groove with a pretty melody about a woman disconnecting from an unhealthy relationship. This song addressed a man who was verbally and emotionally abusive, controlling, non-communicative and self-centered. As a holiday treat for her increasing number of fans, KEA showcased her unique interpretive skills with a haunting rendition of Motown legend William “Smokey” Robinson’s winter of 1980 classic, “Being with You.” Where Robinson's rendition took a deceptively breezy musical approach about a man desper-ate to keep a lover, KEA dug into the darker psychological impact of the words. KEA’s version of "Being with You" is known on the charts of America and the U.K. and she has achieved success on Digital Radio Tracker, Top 30 on the Urban Influencer urban chart, coveted streams on I-Heart radio, and supportive U.S. stations such as WFSK in Nashville, KCCB in Corning, Arkansas, and Top 10 status at Buffalo, New York's WUFO. Promising more provocative songs with intriguing titles such as “Black Man,” “Black Beauty”, and “Pieces of a Man,” KEA’s goals are for mainstream and international suc-cess. She has performed at hometown Pittsburgh events and venues such as the Channel 11 News Holiday Parade, Stars at Riverview Jazz Series, The Birthright of Pittsburgh, the Explore East Liberty 2018 Wine Festival, the Harambe Black Arts Festi-val, the Christine Fréchard Gallery, and the Carnegie Arts Initiative (Jazz On 3rd). The Black Lives Matter movement inspired "Holla if You Hear Me” and it quickly be-came one of Amazon’s hottest new releases. KEA also achieved success on the UK Soul chart and the ‘National Indie Soul Chart’ platforms ranking in the top . She was even invited to perform for their BMMAC (Black Music Month Award Ceremony in Buffalo, New York. During the ceremony, she met Gary Hines, Music Director and Pro-ducer of the 3-time Grammy Award-Winning Sounds of Blackness. In the words of Gary Hines, he said about her performance, "She killed tonight; she is amazing." He told KEA, "You are a phenomenal woman." Her success continued with “We made it thru” and “Turn it Around” — two releases that continued to show her ever-expanded range of lyric skills and ability to get to the heart of issues that really matter. But there is more to KEA than writing and recording. She is an artist who knows what it means to connect in-person with real people. Always close to her community, she has been something of a staple in Pittsburgh's en-tertainment scene. The Downtown Pittsburgh Partnership and Walnut Capital and opening the Picklesburgh three-day festival held at the iconic Andy Warhol Bridge are all on her list of achievements. She even performed at “The Biggest Party of the Year”, Pittsburgh's Light Up Night festival. KEA has been booked throughout the year and is always excited to connect with a new crowd with lyrics and sounds that are always raw, real, and straight from the heart. Kai is a trained drummer who mastered his craft while studying at Florissant Valley Community College followed by a stint at Indiana University School of Music, Bloomington, IN. It was at I.U. where his passion fully took hold and he played in a plethora of bands, operas, symphonies and musicals. Notable productions include Barber of Seville, Cabaret, Working, Meet Me In St. Louis and Phantom of the Opera. He has also toured with Krystol who had a top ten billboard hit with “Passion for a Woman” writ-ten by Randy Jackson and opened for Morris Day, ConFunkShun and the Jetts. A year later and he toured with Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, followed by performances with Miki Howard and Jean Carne across a range of LA venues. A notable career highlight was having the opportunity to rehearse with Stevie Wonder for sev-eral months in his Wonderland studio. Big things continued when Kai toured with L.L. Cool J on the Budweiser Tour alongside Whitney Houston, Keith Sweat, Digital Underground and many more. This was all before his passion for music took him to Japan with members of Earth, Wind & Fire, as well as several other groups of that era. Jump forward to 1994 and you may remember seeing him perform on Saturday Night Live with the one and only Snoop Doggy Dogg. Hot off the back of that he received a full cymbal, stick and merchandise endorsement from Zildjian and continued to do his thing like no one else. Along the way he took instruction at UCLA where Randy Jackson (then A&R VP at A&M Rec-ords) and Barry Squire (then A&R manager at Columbia Records) taught him like only they can. He soon headed over to Capitol Records where he would work on the iconic Paul McCartney’s “Back in the U.S.” tour in 2001. Check in with Kai back in 2009 and you’ll have found him recording 8 tracks on Bone Thugs-N-Harmony’s “The World’s Enemy” CD. He was based in LA during this part of his career and worked on everything from heavy metal to country, before making the move to Pittsburgh 4 years ago. Since arriving in the City of Bridges, Kai has played with Mike Sheer, Craig King, Eric Johnson (jazz), Tony Campbell, and others at Backstage Bar, Thunderbird, R Bar, and James Street. You’ll find him teaching drumming at Nstuff Music where he continues to share his passion with the next generation. Enter your Username and Password to login to your account. Don't have an account?

Depictions of the crucified Christ are common in both churches and art museums, though the specifics can vary widely. The Bible gives scant details and leaves a lot of room for imagination, and artists of every era have been quick to add their own creative touches. From Byzantine works that adhered closely to theological doctrine, to Western wealthy patrons with their own ideas about how the crucifixion should be shown, to modern artists creating passionate testaments to their personal beliefs as well as their views on politics and social justice, there is much to examine through visual representations of this singular, profound event. Arcangelo Cola da Camerino, Italian, The Madonna and Child, Enthroned; Crucifixion, circa 1420-1422, tempera on panel, 20 x 23 1/4 in. Frick Art & Historical Center.

The Frick Pittsburgh is an exceptional example of a planned gift at its most generous—Helen Clay Frick left provisions in her will for Clayton, her childhood family home, to be restored and opened to the public along with The Frick Art Museum and the family’s car and carriage collection. That foresight has enabled The Frick Pittsburgh to evolve into the unique museum we have today. You, too, can create a legacy that will help ensure that the Frick continues to serve students and families well into the future. In addition to making a difference in the lives of others, a planned gift can provide tax savings or income benefits for you and your family. There are many ways to make such a gift—simple methods include gifts in your will or living trust, gifts of life insurance, gifts of retirement assets, and more. To make the process of legacy giving easy, The Frick has partnered with FreeWill for our community to create an estate plan for free. FreeWill’s secure online tool empowers you to write a legally valid will or trust in about 20 minutes. As you write your will, FreeWill presents you with the opportunity to make a planned gift to The Frick on your terms. If you have ‘non-probate’ assets like a life insurance policy that you’d like to donate, you can use this FreeWill tool to log all of these assets and name The Frick as a beneficiary. If you have already created a legacy by including a gift in your estate plan, will you please complete this form to let us know? This helps us update our records and thank you for building a legacy to support The Frick’s authentic experiences with art, history, and nature. Dr. Moitra understands the impact that art, history, and nature can have on someone. As a graduate student, Moitra appreciated the ability to come and visit the The Frick Art Museum for free when he didn’t have many resources. “I think it’s so important to have this opportunity, especially if you’re interested in art but can’t afford to pay the price of admission,” Moitra says. As an adult, Moitra retained his love of art and was compelled to join the Frick as a member, remembering the effect the museums had on him in his younger years. Thinking about his own legacy, he also decided to make a planned gift to the Frick, knowing that his gift would make it possible for future generations of students to visit, as he had. The Frick has been a key part of Dr. Moitra’s life for many years, and he feels it is important to give back, support the future of the institution, and ensure that anyone can find sanctuary on our campus. We are so thankful for members like Dr. Moitra, who have a positive impact on everything we do here. While some prefer to leave a gift in their wills or estates, others appreciate the increased flexibility of a beneficiary designation. You might consider using: It only takes three simple steps to name The Frick Pittsburgh as a beneficiary: Thank you for considering The Frick Pittsburgh to be the recipient of these gifts from the heart. It’s truly an honor to be included in the legacy of someone who cares so deeply about providing accessible cultural assets in the Pittsburgh region.

Frick Societies members enjoy all the benefits of membership, plus much more! 1882 is the year that Henry Clay Frick purchased the Italianate-style home we know today as Clayton, the cornerstone of the Frick’s collections. Members of the 1882 Society are, likewise, cornerstones of the vital philanthropic support necessary to advance the museum’s mission. The Rubens Society is named after the renowned seventeenth-century Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, whose Portrait of Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency, Princess of Condé (ca. 1610) is one of the most admired works in the Frick’s collection. Named for the enduring history of the Frick family’s Gilded Age home, the Clayton Society is composed of individuals committed to the sustainability and future of The Frick Pittsburgh. Recognized by Architectural Digest as "a triumph of restoration," Clayton is a stunning late-nineteenth-century mansion, and the only surviving example of a home on Pittsburgh’s lost "Millionaire’s Row." The Helen Clay Frick Society honors the legacy of the Frick’s founder and benefactress. Members enjoy the distinction of being part of a vital group to support the Frick’s mission to provide memorable experiences with art, history, and nature that inspire and delight.

"Our tour guide was excellent! Her knowledge and command of the history was excellent. It was clear that she has a love of her job. That's engaging. We had a youngster (about 10 - 12 years old) in our group. He was very bright and was not shy. Our guide did an excellent job of responding to him while not losing track of her objective. She integrated his quizzical mind into the interaction. It was actually amusing to the entire group. I really appreciate the efforts that the museum put into the development of the new tours." - William S.

Pittsburgh Area Farmers' Markets and U-Pick Farms Pittsburgh food has always been rooted in tradition and fresh off the farm. As a result, farmers' markets are a well established part of Pittsburgh culture. There are more farmers' markets and community gardens per capita in Pittsburgh than in most U.S. metropolitan areas. In season, you can find one just about every day of the week in different neighborhoods. Whether it's a church parking lot, a sidewalk stand, or a tent off the side of the road, these markets sell local farm fresh produce, eggs, cheese, homemade baked goods, jams and honey. Some farmers' markets even sell Amish-made wood furniture and rugs. For a complete list of Pittsburgh area farmers' markets, click here. If you want to get a little closer to your food, try harvesting your own produce at Pittsburgh area U-Pick Farms. You'll get some exercise as well as a great big bunch of fresh produce you picked yourself. Visiting a u-pick farm is a great family experience that is both fun and educational. There's something about harvesting your own food that makes you appreciate it more. Many U-Pick farms also have on-site stores selling other ready-to-go products from their farm. Many Pittsburgh area residents enter in to a more formal agreement with local farmers to ensure their seasonal supply of farm fresh products; including farm fresh beef and other meats. This is a relatively new and growing trend called, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). These agreements, and the products offered, vary by farm and help local families enjoy a variety of farm fresh products while providing local farmers a profitable outlet for their harvest. 72 0 Saved
