FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Dauri Moreta never had a serious arm issue until last year. That didn’t ease the blow when it finally happened.                         Moreta was one of the top arms out of the Pirates' bullpen in 2023, striking out 76 hitters over 58 innings en route to a 3.72

BRADENTON, Fla. – The Pirates’ strength in pitching is obvious. This is the organization that drafted Paul Skenes after all and saw him become the National League All-Star starter one year later. Jared Jones and Mitch Keller serve as more developmental success stories on the bump, and Top 100 prospects

The second edition of Spring Breakout is bursting with high-profile prospects. A whopping 69 members of MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 are slated to participate, including Red Sox outfielder Roman Anthony (No. 2), Tigers outfielder Max Clark (No. 6), Red Sox infielder Kristian Campbell (No. 7), Rays shortstop Carson Williams (No.

Who will be the best pitcher in each league in 2025?                         Last season, there was no question that the Tigers' Tarik Skubal and the Braves' Chris Sale surpassed every other arm. Both claimed a Triple Crown en route to winning their first Cy Young Award.

The inaugural Spring Breakout in 2024 provided a platform for fans to meet many of baseball's top prospects before they began standing out in the Majors shortly thereafter.                         Paul Skenes striking out Jackson Holliday. Jackson Chourio reaching twice and scoring a run. Jace Jung hitting a pair of homers.

BRADENTON, Fla. – As we continue to inch toward Opening Day at loanDepot Park, let’s take another shot at projecting what the Pirates’ roster will look like. This is the Opening Day roster, version 2.0.

This page will be updated throughout the year with all the latest Pirates injury news and transactions.

When players are taken in the early rounds of the MLB Draft, it’s easy to dream about seeing them under the bright lights of the big leagues, but a common refrain has been that fans don't get to see those players for years after they're selected.                         Thanks to Spring Breakout,

BRADENTON, Fla. -- Mitch Keller is a man of many pitches. It’s a good thing PitchComs are the norm now because there aren’t catchers with enough fingers to call his seven pitches: a four-seam fastball, sinker, slider, sweeper, cutter, curveball and changeup, his least-used pitch in 2024.                         Keller threw that

LAKELAND, Fla. -- Ryan Borucki has been in this spot before, but it certainly is a departure from a year ago.                         In 2023, Borucki went from a midseason Minor League pickup to one of the top relievers in the Pirates’ bullpen, firing sliders and sweepers that left-handed hitters just couldn’t

Ding, ding, who’s ready for Round 2?                         Last year’s inaugural edition of Spring Breakout gave fans early looks at Paul Skenes, Jackson Chourio, Pete Crow-Armstrong, James Wood, Jackson Holliday, Ceddanne Rafaela and many other young stars who graduated off prospect lists in 2024. Not only does it serve as a

Across the league, this season's Opening Day rosters are taking shape. But for every club, there's still at least one big league job left to be won.                         Here's a look at how those positional battles are unfolding less than three weeks from Opening Day.                         Jump to: AL East | AL

NORTH PORT, Fla. -- It has been a very different Spring Training for Mike Burrows compared to a year ago. In 2024, he was still rehabbing back from Tommy John surgery with no chance to break camp with the club.

Spring Training is the season of new pitches. Tons of pitchers all around big league camps are experimenting with their repertoires and adding to their arsenals.                         Some new pitches stick, some don't. But let's try to find the ones that are worth paying attention to as the 2025 regular season

BRADENTON, Fla. -- When the Pirates traded Josh Bell to the Nationals in the winter of 2020, they got two very different types of pitchers in return. One was Wil Crowe, a Major League-ready prospect. The other was Eddy Yean, a 19-year-old complete unknown with only 10 games of Rookie

BRADENTON, Fla. -- As the Pirates took the field at Ed Smith Stadium ahead of a 9-5 win over the Orioles on Thursday, they unofficially crossed into the second half of Spring Training. That sweet spot of the schedule where they’re three weeks removed from pitchers and catchers reporting and

BRADENTON, Fla. -- Before he took the league by storm last year, Paul Skenes’ largest platform was at the inaugural Spring Breakout game. He had been billed as a top prospect before that game, but after he mowed down the Orioles’ top prospects, he firmly established that he was special.

It’s time to crown a new king.                         After a three-year run for the Orioles atop our preseason farm system rankings, they’ve stepped off the throne, making way for the Tigers. The O’s had slipped from the top spot in our 2024 midseason rankings as they’d graduated a number of prospects

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. – Greetings from Arizona everyone. While my Spring Training coverage officially starts on Saturday, I arrived early enough on Friday to enjoy the .... 50 degree temps and rain?                         Maybe I’m still in Pittsburgh? Or maybe I’m just delirious after working to get out all of the Top

Two of MLB’s biggest stars delivered memorable MVP seasons in 2024.                         In the American League, Yankees slugger Aaron Judge rivaled his AL-record 62-home-run 2022 campaign, hitting 58 homers with an 1.159 OPS to capture his second MVP Award. In the National League, Shohei Ohtani created the 50-50 club in his

BRADENTON, Fla. -- Johan Oviedo suffered a setback after his last live batting practice, resulting in him being placed on the 60-day injured list on Monday with an injury to the right lat muscle. After consulting with Dr. Keith Meister, the surgeon who performed his Tommy John surgery, Oviedo's return

BRADENTON, Fla. -- Justin Lawrence first started to experiment with his arm slot his freshman year of college with Jacksonville University. He was a stock right-hander who was throwing over the top and not getting a ton of playing time, so he got creative and became a sidearmer. He grew
