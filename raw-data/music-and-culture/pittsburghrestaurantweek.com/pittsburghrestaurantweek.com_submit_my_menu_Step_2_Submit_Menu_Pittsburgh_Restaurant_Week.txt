Each restaurant is expected to create a limited-time, small menu that is offered for dine-in guests between the dates of the celebration. Ideally, this special menu is in addition to the restaurant’s normal menu. While many restaurants opt for a multi-course menu with multiple options per course, that is not the designated requirement.

A multi-course meal – OR – Specialty Dishes priced for the Year

Dinner is the “required” course, but lunch and brunch special menus are also permitted in addition to the dine-in dinner.
