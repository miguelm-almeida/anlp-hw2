Opera Connections guests from Pittsburgh Faison ES at a performance of Il Trovatore at the Benedum Center.

Connecting the opera to the community, this program provides opportunities for parents and children from select Pittsburgh neighborhoods to attend opera performances together—to experience art as a family. At Pittsburgh Opera, we believe in reaching out to our friends who might not normally be able to attend arts performances, and we believe in preparing them to attend through pre-performance workshops. What better way to experience the magic of opera than to attend with a family member!

To get more information about opera programs for families, please contact Marilyn Michalka Egan, Ph.D., Director of Education, at 412-281-0912, ext. 242.
