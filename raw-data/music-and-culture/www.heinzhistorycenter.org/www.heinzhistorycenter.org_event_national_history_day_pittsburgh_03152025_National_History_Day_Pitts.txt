Join the History Center for the region’s National History Day competition.

Thousands of students participate in National History Day each year. The Heinz History Center is proud to be the regional home for this competition, serving students from Allegheny, Washington, Greene, Fayette, Westmoreland, and Somerset counties.

This year’s competition will be at the museum on March 15-16 and explore the theme, “Rights & Responsibilities in History.”

National History Day (NHD) draws upon a unique historical theme each year and encourages middle school and high school students to research history in an exciting and creative way. Students can enter one of five categories—paper, performance, documentary, exhibit, or website. Students may enter as individuals or in teams of 2-5 for all categories except paper, in which students must compete individually. Students are split into a junior division (grades 6-8 on Saturday, March 15) and senior division (grades 9-12 on Sunday, March 16).

Each category is judged separately. First, second, and third place winners from the junior and senior divisions move on to the state competition. The top winners from the state competition then move on to the national competition in June.
