The Steelers acquired receiver DK Metcalf in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks. The Steelers will send the Seahawks their second round pick (52nd overall) and seventh round pick (223rd overall) in the 2025 NFL Draft, and receive the Seahawks sixth-round pick (185th overall) in the 2025 NFL Draft. Metcalf also signed a new five-year contract with the team.

Metcalf was drafted by the Seahawks in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft and spent the last six seasons in Seattle.

In those six seasons, he has appeared in 97 games, starting 93 of them, and has 438 receptions for 6,324 yards, a 14.4-yard average, and 48 touchdowns, which rank eighth-most among active players in the NFL. He has three touchdowns longer than 70 yards, including a career long 84-yard touchdown.

Metcalf has 15 100-yard games, including one against the Steelers in 2023, and a career-high 177 yards receiving against the Philadelphia Eagles in 2020. He also has two 100-yard receiving games in the postseason. He also has three 1,000-yard seasons and has 13 catches of 50 yards or more in his career, which ranks seventh among active receivers..

Metcalf was a second-team Associated Press All-Pro selection in 2020 and a two-time Pro Bowl selection in 2020 and 2023.

In 2024, Metcalf appeared in 15 games, starting 12 of them. He had 66 receptions for 992 yards, a 15-yard average, and five touchdowns.

Metcalf became one of only two players in NFL history, along with Hall of Famer Randy Moss, with 50 receptions, 900 yards and five touchdowns in each of their first six seasons. He also became the first player in Seahawks history with three consecutive 100-yard games, doing so in Weeks 2-4.

He ranks first in Seahawks' history with receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns in his first six seasons and is fourth on the franchise's all-time receiving list.

Metcalf had his third 1,000-yard season in 2023 when he started 16 games, pulling in 66 receptions for 1,114 yards and eight touchdowns, including a 73-yard touchdown, which was Seattle's longest play from scrimmage for the season. His 1,114 yards made him the seventh player in Seahawks history with back-to-back 1,000 yard receiving seasons.

He set a single-season career-high in 2022 when he had 90 receptions, which were fourth-most in Seahawks history. He also turned in his second 1,000-yard season, pulling in 90 receptions for 1,048 yards and six touchdowns.

Metcalf led the Seahawks with 75 receptions in 2021, while adding a team-high 12 touchdowns, which ranked fourth in the NFL and were tied for third-most in a single-season for the Seahawks. He had a career-long 84-yard touchdown against New Orleans, the third-longest reception in team history.

In 2020, Metcalf posted his first 1,000-yard season when he had 83 receptions for a career-high 1,303 yards and 10 touchdowns, while being named second-team AP All-Pro and being selected to the Pro Bowl. The 1,303 receiving yards were a team record, passing Steve Largent who held the previous record of 1,287 yards.

It didn't take Metcalf long to make an impact, with 58 receptions for 900 yards and seven touchdowns in 2019. His 58 receptions were second among all NFL rookie receivers, while his 900 receiving yards were third. Both the receptions and yardage numbers were second all-time in Seahawks' single-season history by a rookie.

Metcalf played college football at Ole Miss, where he started 19 of 21 games played before leaving after his redshirt sophomore year. He had 67 receptions for 1,228 yards and 14 touchdowns.
