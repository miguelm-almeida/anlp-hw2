Pittsburgh Steelers Community Relations Mission Statement

The Pittsburgh Steelers are proud to be a part of the Western Pennsylvania community. The organization's strong commitment to this area dates back to 1933 when Arthur J. Rooney, Sr. founded the team. Current President Art Rooney II is known as one of the most active NFL owners and one of Pittsburgh's most involved executives in civic affairs, as was his father, the late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney. Steelers players, coaches and front office staff are involved in appearances, charitable donations and outreach programs with nonprofit and community groups. It's our way of giving back to the community that has given us so much!
