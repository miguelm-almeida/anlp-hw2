## The CMU Fund

## Your Gift, Your Choice

## Thank You

Your annual gift shapes the daily lives of our students and faculty by enhancing the educational environment, accelerating leading-edge research, funding scholarships and fellowships, and providing other opportunities for students and faculty to grow, learn and make their ambitions a reality.

Gifts to the CMU Fund are not restricted to any specific program, department or school and instead go directly into the operating budget. This allows CMU to remain nimble and responsive to unforeseen challenges and new opportunities as they arise. Your gift gives CMU the flexibility it needs to undertake critical initiatives and attract world-renowned faculty and talented students each year.

Whatever your interest, your gift can support it at CMU. We value your generosity and your choice of where to direct your annual support. CMU offers numerous funds, colleges and departments, initiatives, organizations and projects where you can express your philanthropic passion. Explore the ways you can support what matters to you at CMU.

We are incredibly grateful to loyal supporters of this institution. One way we honor your generosity is through donor recognition societies. For example, those who make gifts of $2,500 or more each year are welcomed into the prestigious Andrew Carnegie Society, which also offers opportunities for engaging leadership and volunteering. Those who give to CMU for 25 consecutive years are recognized as lifetime members of the Order of the May, a select group of our most dedicated donors.

Thank you for supporting Carnegie Mellon University. Your contribution is essential to our future.
