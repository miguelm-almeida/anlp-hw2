Celebrate the ‘can do’ spirit and rich history of the Pittsburgh region by attending an annual History Center fundraising event. From the museum’s yearly 21+ party, History Uncorked, to its black-tie gala, History Makers Award Dinner, the Smithsonian’s home in Pittsburgh is dedicated to bringing people together, preserving our shared history, and inspiring the leaders of tomorrow.

Annual fundraising events directly impact the museum’s award-winning exhibitions, public programs, educational outreach, and publications. Because of your support, our team preserves and cares for hundreds of thousands of historic artifacts and archival materials for future generations.

For more information about sponsorship, please contact Angela Gaitaniella at 412-454-6405 or email.

The History Makers Award Dinner is a tradition that celebrates exceptional individuals with connections to Western Pennsylvania, whose accomplishments transcend geographic bounds.

Pittsburgh’s #1 party for young professionals, History Uncorked is an annual 21+ party that supports the History Center’s award-winning exhibitions, events, educational programs, and more.

Come throw out the pallino and throw down for a worthy cause! The Bocce Tournament & Festival supports the History Center’s Italian American Program.
