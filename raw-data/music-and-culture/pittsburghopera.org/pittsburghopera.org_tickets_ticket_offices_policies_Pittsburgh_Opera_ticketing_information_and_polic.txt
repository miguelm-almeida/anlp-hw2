The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust has implemented new security and bag policies, effective starting October 1, 2016, at the Benedum Center and their other venues. You can read their Safety & Security statement, which includes an updated list of prohibited items, and read their Bag Policy, on their website.

Pittsburgh Opera's official online ticketing site homepage is opera.culturaldistrict.org, which we operate in partnership with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's online ticketing site trustarts.org. If you do not see culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org in the webpage's URL, you are not using our official ticketing website and are likely on a reseller website.

The risks of buying from a reseller include:

You may pay more than face value.

Your tickets may not be real.

Your tickets may not be able to be replaced when lost or stolen.

Pittsburgh Opera cannot give you a refund if you have to cancel, since you did not buy the ticket from us.

Pittsburgh Opera cannot contact you with crucial information on show cancellations, time changes, road closures or traffic updates, upcoming shows or other useful information.

Tickets purchased from unofficial sources are done so at a risk. By purchasing only from opera.culturaldistrict.org or trustarts.org you are assured that the ticket you receive is valid and is being sold to you at current face value.

Resellers go to great lengths to come up first in Google search results, and often use official-sounding names such as "Ticket Network", "Box Office Ticket Sales", "Ticket Smarter", "Ticket City", and so on. Don't be fooled!

The seating configuration for Pittsburgh Opera performances at the George R. White Opera Studio in our Bitz Opera Factory headquarters varies by production. Below is the seating chart which will be used for Woman with Eyes Closed.

To ensure that all operagoers have a good experience, latecomers will be taken to the best available seat that does not disturb other patrons until intermission. Management accepts no responsibility for the inconvenience and can make no exceptions for late arrivals. Refunds or exchanges are NOT issued to latecomers.

Late seating is handled on a show-by-show basis. Please note that for some of our shows at other venues, including at the Bitz Opera Factory, there is no late seating. When possible without disrupting the performance, Pittsburgh Opera will make every attempt to accommodate late arrivals. Management accepts no responsibility for the inconvenience and can make no exceptions for late arrivals. Refunds or exchanges are NOT issued to latecomers. Please allow ample travel time so that if you encounter unexpected traffic, road construction, accidents, full parking garages, etc., you are still able to arrive at the theater for the start of the performance.

Supertitles, the English translations projected above the stage, will be fully visible to most Benedum Center customers. However, supertitles will not be visible to anyone seated in row W and behind on the Main Floor, or the side sections of rows W-ZZ on the Main Floor.

An Emergency Register Book is located in the Benedum Center entrance lobby to the right of the entry doors. Refer emergency calls to 412-456-2610. Please turn off pagers, cell phones, and watches during the performance and notify your contact of the emergency number and your seat location. This theater is equipped with an Automated External Defibrillator.

Limited to performers, staff, and authorized visitors.

Located at all levels and clearly marked. Use ONLY in case of emergency.

The use of cameras, cell phones, and tape recorders in the auditorium is strictly prohibited.

Cast and opera subject to change without notice. All ticket sales are final.
