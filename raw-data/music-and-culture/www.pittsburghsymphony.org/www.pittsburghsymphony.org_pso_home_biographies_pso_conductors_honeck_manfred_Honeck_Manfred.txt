Manfred Honeck's successful work in Pittsburgh is being extensively            documented by recordings on the Reference Recordings label, featuring            works by Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Shostakovich, Strauss,            Tchaikovsky, and others. They have received a multitude of outstanding            reviews and awards, including many GRAMMY® nominations, and he and the            orchestra won the GRAMMY® for "Best Orchestral Performance" in 2018.

Born in Austria, Manfred Honeck completed his musical training at the            University of Music in Vienna. His many years of experience as a            member of the viola section in the Vienna Philharmonic and Vienna            State Opera Orchestra have had a lasting influence on his work as a            conductor, and his art of interpretation is based on his determination            to venture deep beneath the surface of the music. He began his            conducting career as assistant to Claudio Abbado and as director of            the Vienna Jeunesse Orchestra. Subsequently, he was engaged by the            Zurich Opera House, where he was awarded the European Conducting Prize            in 1993. He has since served as one of three principal conductors of            the MDR Symphony Orchestra Leipzig, as Music Director of the Norwegian            National Opera, Principal Guest Conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic            Orchestra and Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chief Conductor of the            Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in Stockholm. In November 2023, he            was appointed Honorary Conductor by the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra,            following decades of close collaboration.

Manfred Honeck also has a strong profile as opera conductor. In his            four seasons as General Music Director of the Staatsoper Stuttgart, he            conducted premieres of operas by Berlioz, Mozart, Poulenc, Strauss,            Verdi, and Wagner. He has also appeared as guest at leading houses            such as Semperoper Dresden, Komische Oper Berlin, Théâtre de la            Monnaie in Brussels, Royal Opera of Copenhagen, and the Salzburg            Festival. In 2020, Beethoven’s anniversary year, he conducted a new            staging of Fidelio (1806 version) at the Theater an der Wien. In            autumn 2022, he made his much-acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York,             leading a revival of Mozart’s Idomeneo. Beyond the            podium, Manfred Honeck has designed a series of symphonic suites,            including Janáček’s Jenůfa, Strauss’s Elektra, Dvořák’s Rusalka as            well as Puccini's Turandot which he regularly performs around the            globe. The most recent arrangement, of Strauss’s Salome, was premiered            by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2023.

As a guest conductor, Manfred Honeck has worked with all leading            international orchestras, including Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra,            Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig,            Staatskapelle Dresden, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Royal Concertgebouw            Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Accademia di            Santa Cecilia Rome and the Vienna Philharmonic. In the United States,            he has conducted all major US orchestras, including New York            Philharmonic, The Cleveland Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los            Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony            Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. He has also been Artistic            Director of the International Concerts Wolfegg in Germany for thirty            years.

In 2024-2025, Manfred Honeck will conduct fourteen wide-ranging            programs and several special projects in Pittsburgh, including all            four of the season's world premieres and commissions. He also will            return to the New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony,            Concertgebouworkest Amsterdam, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and            Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, amongst others. In Bruckner's            anniversary year of 2024, he will continue to place a special focus on            the music of this composer.
