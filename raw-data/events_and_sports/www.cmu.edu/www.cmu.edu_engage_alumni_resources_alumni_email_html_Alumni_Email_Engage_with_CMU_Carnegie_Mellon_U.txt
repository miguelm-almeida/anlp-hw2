CMU offers full @alumni.cmu.edu email accounts, powered by G Suite, exclusively to all alumni.

Email accounts are automatically available for alumni from the Classes of 2015 to present. Please note: Alumni who graduated prior to 2015 can request an account. If you would like to request an account or are unable to access alumni email, please contact alumni-email@andrew.cmu.edu for assistance.

With G Suite @alumni.cmu.edu email, you can:

You can access your account by logging in using your Andrew ID and password through your preferred web browser at http://mail.alumni.cmu.edu. Access using a mobile device or email client requires a separate G Suite password.

In order to provide an additional level of account protection, the university is enrolling alumni in two-factor authentication (2fa). This is parallel to the login process used for the CMU community of students, faculty and staff.

All @alumni.cmu.edu email address users will need to enroll in 2fa by Wednesday, December 15, 2021.

2FA provides a secondary checkpoint to verify your identity. Here is how it works:

It takes just a few minutes to register. Visit How to Use 2fa for step-by-step instructions on getting started with DUO.

Forgot your Andrew password?

Please direct any questions to alumni-email@andrew.cmu.edu.

For alumni who graduated prior to 2015, you can request your alumni email address by contacting the Alumni Association at alumni-email@andrew.cmu.edu. You will receive an email confirming your request, as well as further instructions regarding the activation of your Andrew ID for login purposes in subsequent communications. Your alumni email name will be assigned by the university. Your alumni email address will be NAME@alumni.cmu.edu.

Please Note: The university is no longer able to support @alumni.carnegiemellon.edu email addresses that were created under the previous email forwarding system.

Current Students Preparing to GraduateYes, as a graduate of Carnegie Mellon, your @andrew.cmu.edu and @cmu.edu alias will cease to function approximately 90 days after graduation. As you prepare for the loss of this account, you should read the Computing Services recommendations for graduating students.

The new @alumni.cmu.edu email will use your Andrew ID as your name, but will use the "alumni" designation in your email, i.e. "acarnegie@alumni.cmu.edu."

No, but you should pull the data from your @andrew email using the Google Takeout tools. Detailed information can be found on the Computing Services website.

Logging into your alumni email is simple. All it requires is an Andrew ID and password. Recent graduates will already know their account information, as it is the same as what you use to log into other university services. For alumni wishing to create an alumni email, your Andrew ID will need to be reactivated or created to allow you to access your alumni email. This will be taken care of as part of the process of requesting an alumni email.

Note: If you wish to access your alumni email via mobile device, check out the handy tutorial and FAQs from CMU's Computing Services to learn more about setting up your device and email client.

To access your email from a mobile device, download the Google Mail mobile app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
