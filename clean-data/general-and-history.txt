Pittsburgh,  city, seat (1788) of Allegheny county, southwestern Pennsylvania, U.S. The city is located at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers, which unite at the point of the “Golden Triangle” (the business district) to form the Ohio River. A city of hills, parks, and valleys, it is the centre of an urban industrial complex that includes the surrounding cities of Aliquippa (northwest), New Kensington (northeast), McKeesport (southeast), and Washington (southwest) and the borough of Wilkinsburg (east). Inc. borough, 1794; city, 1816. Area city, 58 square miles (150 square km). Pop. (2010) 305,704; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,356,285; (2020) 302,971; Pittsburgh Metro Area, 2,370,930.

Algonquian- and Iroquoian-speaking peoples were early inhabitants of the region. The conflict between the British and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and his British and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for the British statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the source of the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in 1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and a boundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by John Campbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the town became an outfitting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.

Pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resources spurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. A blast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was the forerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a century was the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known as the “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad, both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping. The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks of businesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed by fire.

After the American Civil War, great numbers of European immigrants swelled Pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnates such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellon built their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historic friction between labour and management, and the American Federation of Labor was born there in 1881.

By 1900 the city’s population had reached 321,616. Growth continued nearly unabated through World War II, the war years bringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The population crested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadily declined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the 1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but the growing African American proportion of the population exceeded one-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth, Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city. After the war, however, the city undertook an extensive redevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control, flood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the first American city to generate electricity by nuclear power.

By the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtually disappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand. Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste by unemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, the U.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrived before succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty. Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversified its economy through more emphasis on light industries—though metalworking, chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation (robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies. Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasingly important. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportation centre.

Much of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes Point State Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum), the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The University of Pittsburgh was chartered in 1787. Other educational institutions include Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park (1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and two campuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966).

Central to the city’s cultural life is the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh (formerly Carnegie Institute), an umbrella organization consisting of a number of institutions. Its museums include those for the fine arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the Carnegie Science Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr., Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum (1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist and filmmaker. Other institutions affiliated with the organization are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 million volumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performs at Heinz Hall, a restored movie theatre.

Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensive greenhouses. The city’s zoo, in the northeastern Highland Park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. Two new sports venues opened in 2001 on the north bank of the Allegheny opposite the Golden Triangle: PNC Park is home of the Pirates, the city’s professional baseball team, and Acrisure Stadium houses the Steelers, its professional football team. The Penguins, Pittsburgh’s professional ice hockey team, plays at PPG Paints Arena. Popular summertime attractions include riverboat excursions on Pittsburgh’s waterways and Kennywood, an amusement park southeast of the city in West Mifflin.

Pittsburgh (/ˈpɪtsbɜːrɡ/ PITS-burg) is a city in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, and its county seat. It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania (after Philadelphia) and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S., with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city is located in southwestern Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[7] It anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, which had a population of 2.457 million residents and is the largest metro area in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area which includes parts of Ohio and West Virginia.

Pittsburgh is known as "the Steel City" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry.[8] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[9] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[10] Deindustrialization in the late 20th century resulted in massive layoffs among blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, coinciding with several Pittsburgh-based corporations moving out of the city.[11] However, the city divested from steel and, since the 1990s, Pittsburgh has focused its energies on the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[12][13]

Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Allegheny Health Network, as well as 68 colleges and universities, including Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research, and the nuclear navy.[15] The city is home to ten Fortune 500 companies and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. Pittsburgh is sometimes called the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges.[8] Its rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[16] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.

Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by Scottish General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).[17][18]

Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[19]
"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever."[20]

From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as "Pittsburg", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[21][17] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed.[17] The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.[22]

Kingdom of France 1690s–1763  Great Britain 1681–1781  United States 1776–present

The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[23] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[24]: 289

The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[25][better source needed] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[26]

In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[26] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[27] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named "Pittsborough".[28]

During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[29][30][31][32]

During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the "Manor of Pittsburgh".[33] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.

On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[34][35] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[36]

Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.

The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[37] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[38]

The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.

In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany.

Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[39] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[40] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[39]

The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.

In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.

The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[42]

The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.

The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[43] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[44] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[45]

During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[28] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the "arsenal of democracy"[46][47] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being "hell with the lid off."[48]

Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[11]

In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.

During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[49]

In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[50]

Pittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.

The city is located on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[51] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as "the Point." The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.

Many Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to "hills," "heights," or similar features.[a]

The steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[52] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[53]

Bike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.

The city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[54] and four main areas surrounding it—Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End. These areas are further divided into 90 neighborhoods.[55]

Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine over 500 feet (150 m), with the U.S. Steel Tower being the tallest at 841 ft (256 m).[56] The Cultural District spans 14 blocks along the Allegheny River and is home to theaters, arts venues, and a growing residential community. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[57] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.

The North Side, originally the independent Allegheny City until being annexed in 1907, is a primarily residential area with well-preserved 19th-century homes. It hosts attractions like Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, the Andy Warhol Museum, and the National Aviary, among others.[58]

The South Side, once home to railyards and mill workers, has seen revitalization with improvements to East Carson Street and new retail. It is now a vibrant neighborhood with diverse shopping and nightlife.[59] In the 1990s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property and redeveloped it into the SouthSide Works mixed-use development.

The East End includes key institutions including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History, and Phipps Conservatory. It features many parks, including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo, and vibrant neighborhoods like Shadyside. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland is home to several universities and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs.[61]

The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the "northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia."[64] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the "Paris of Appalachia",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.

Under the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city lies in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b except along the rivers where the zone is 7a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season, though annual sunshine is low among major US cities at well under 50%.[73]

The warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]

Average annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).

The American Lung Association's 2024 "State of the Air" report, covering data from 2020 to 2022, indicated that while Pittsburgh's air quality is poor, it is improving. The city ranked 26th for short-term particle pollution, earning an F grade, and 19th for year-round particle pollution. It received a D grade for ozone pollution, ranking 50th for ozone smog.[81][82] However, United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data from 2021 to 2024 shows that Pittsburgh's air quality was generally good or moderate.[83][84]

Despite improvements, studies suggest Pittsburgh's air quality still impacts health. A 2014 to 2016 study found that children near pollution sources like industrial sites had asthma rates nearly three times the national average.[85] It also revealed that 38% of students lived in areas exceeding EPA's particle pollution standards, and 70% in areas surpassing the WHO's standards.[85] Most affected communities were minority populations, leading some residents to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.[86]

As of 2005, Pittsburgh had 31,000 trees along 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis valued the annual benefits of the city's urban forest between $10 and $13 million, based on contributions to aesthetics, energy use, and air quality. The city invests $850,000 annually in tree planting and maintenance.[87]

Local rivers in Pittsburgh continue to exceed EPA pollution limits, primarily due to frequently overflowing untreated sewage from the city's outdated infrastructure.[88] Pittsburgh's combined sewer system, built in the early 1900s, carries both stormwater and wastewater, with the treatment plant constructed in 1959.[89] Insufficient upgrades have led to public health concerns, as even a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoff to flow into rivers.[90][91] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[92] The Allegheny County Sanitary Authority (ALCOSAN) is under a Consent Decree from the EPA and proposed a $2 billion system upgrade in 2017, approved by the EPA in 2019.[93][94][95]

The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA), responsible for replacing pipes and setting water rates, has faced criticism for alleged mismanagement and for high lead levels in the city's drinking water, particularly in 2016.[96][97][98] While lead levels have risen for years, many residents blame PWSA's administrative changes for the spike.[99][100][101] In response, PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water.[102] PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.[102]

There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children.[103] Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children.[103][104]

At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race. Non-Hispanic whites were 64.8% of the population in 2010,[108] compared to 78.7% in 1970.[109] By the 2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971.[107] Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.

Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation,[115] and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census.[116] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States.[117] Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country.

Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.[118]

In 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95. In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.

Since the 1940s, city initiatives for redevelopment have driven demographic changes in Pittsburgh. In the 1950s, the Lower Hill District underwent significant upheaval when 1,551 mostly Black residents and 413 businesses were displaced for the construction of the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[13] This project, part of Pittsburgh's revitalization efforts, led to the neighborhood's population dropping to an estimated 12,000 today.[124]

In the 1960s, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh (URA) aimed to revitalize East Liberty, resulting in the construction of Penn Center Mall and the displacement of about 3,800 people.[125] By the early 2000s, private developers catering to a wealthier demographic introduced businesses like Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google. This redevelopment, supported by the URA, transformed East Liberty into a desirable area for millennials.[125]

These changes have sparked criticism, with some residents arguing that the government's actions were part of a strategy to disperse Black and low-income populations or facilitate gentrification of neighborhoods.[124][126] The demolition of housing units like the East Mall public housing complex in 2009, replaced by businesses like Target, is cited as evidence of this process.[127]

Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[132] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[133] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[134] or the American Dream.[135] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[136] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[137] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as "the poster child for managing industrial transition".[138] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[139]

In Pittsburghese one would say "the car needs washed" instead of "needs to be washed", "needs washing", or "needs a wash." The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted The New York Times to describe Pittsburgh as "the Galapagos Islands of American dialect".[191] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include babushka, pierogi, and halušky.[192]

Other agencies also provide police protection within the city because of overlapping jurisdictional boundaries. The Allegheny County Sheriff focuses on jail and courthouse security. The Allegheny County Police primarily patrols county-owned parks and airports, while providing detective/investigatory functions for smaller suburbs and the Port Authority police patrols rapid transit. Pennsylvania State Police Troop B provides patrols for the city and immediate suburbs.

The county's lead law enforcement officer is Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala while the Allegheny County Medical Examiner heads forensics. Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania.

Pittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's safest big cities, in 2013 being named the 3rd "most secure" big city by Farmers Insurance.[223] Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[224][225]
Per 100,000 persons stats (2012):

At the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[226]

In Pittsburgh, the homicide rate for African Americans is seven times the national average.[227] Some people believe that over-reliance on law enforcement exacerbates homicide rates.[227] There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim.[228] This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic.[228] This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million.[229] About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.[230]

Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories "police budget cost per person," "fines / forefeitures," "Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population)," "Force Used per Arrest," "Racial Disparities in Deadly Force," "Excessive Force Complaints Upheld," "Discrimination Complaints Upheld," "Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld," "Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses," and "Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests." This is 10 out of 15 categories.[231]

Pittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University. Also in the city are Carlow University, Chatham University, Point Park University, the Community College of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the Pittsburgh Institute of Mortuary Science.

The campuses of Carlow, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Pittsburgh are near each other in the Oakland neighborhood that is the city's traditional cultural center. Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a private research university founded by Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon.[232] CMU contains the Mellon College of Science, School of Computer Science, College of Engineering, School of Business, Heinz College, College of Fine Arts, writing, Social and Decision Sciences, information systems, statistics, and psychology programs.

The University of Pittsburgh, established in 1787 and popularly referred to as "Pitt", is a state-related school with one of the nation's largest research programs.[14] Pitt is known for the Kenneth P. Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences, Swanson School of Engineering, University of Pittsburgh College of Business Administration, University of Pittsburgh School of Law, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work, and other biomedical and health-related sciences.[232][233][234][235][236]

Carlow University is a small private Catholic university that while coeducational, has traditionally educated women. Chatham University, a liberal arts college that was founded as a woman's college but became fully coeducational in 2015,[237] is in the Shadyside neighborhood, but also maintains a 388-acre (157 ha) Eden Hall Farm campus in the North Hills. Duquesne University, a private Catholic university in the Bluff neighborhood and is noted for its song and dance troupe, the Duquesne University Tamburitzans, as well as programs in law, business, and pharmacy. Point Park University was founded in 1961 and is well known for its Conservatory of Performing Arts and its Pittsburgh Playhouse.

Pittsburgh Public Schools teachers are paid well relative to their peers, ranking 17th in 2000 among the 100 largest cities by population for the highest minimum salary. In 2018, the starting teacher salary offered to teachers with a BA was $46,920. The maximum annual salary for a teacher with a master's degree was $95,254.[238]

Local public schools include many charter and magnet schools, including City Charter High School (computer and technology focused), Pittsburgh Montessori School (formerly Homewood Montessori), Pittsburgh Gifted Center, Barack Obama Academy of International Studies 6-12, Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts 6–12, Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy, the Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children, and the Western Pennsylvania School for the Deaf.

Private schools in Pittsburgh include Bishop Canevin High School, Central Catholic High School, Oakland Catholic High School, Winchester Thurston School, St. Edmund's Academy, Hillel Academy of Pittsburgh, Yeshiva Schools and The Ellis School. Shady Side Academy maintains a PK–5 primary school campus in the Point Breeze neighborhood, in addition to its 6–12 middle and upper school campuses in nearby suburban Fox Chapel. Other private institutions outside of Pittsburgh's limits include North Catholic High School and Seton-La Salle Catholic High School.

The city also has an extensive library system, both public and university. Most notable are the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh's University Library System, which rank as the ninth-largest public and 18th-largest academic libraries in the nation, respectively.[239][240]

There are two major daily newspapers in Pittsburgh: the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review online only (no longer in print for Pittsburgh Area). Weekly papers in the region include the Pittsburgh Business Times, Pittsburgh City Paper, Pittsburgh Catholic, Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle, The New People, and the New Pittsburgh Courier. Independent student-written university-based newspapers include The Pitt News of the University of Pittsburgh, The Tartan of Carnegie Mellon University, The Duquesne Duke of Duquesne University, and The Globe of Point Park University. The University of Pittsburgh School of Law is also home to JURIST, the world's only university-based legal news service.[241]

The Pittsburgh metro area is served by multiple local television and radio stations. The Pittsburgh designated market area (DMA) is the 22nd-largest in the U.S. with 1,163,150 homes (1.045% of the total U.S.).[242] The major network television stations include KDKA-TV 2 (CBS), WTAE 4 (ABC), WPXI 11 (NBC), WINP-TV 16 (Ion), WPKD-TV 19 (Independent), WPNT 22 (The CW/MyNetworkTV), WPCB 40 (Cornerstone), and WPGH-TV 53 (Fox). KDKA-TV, WINP-TV, and WPCB are owned-and-operated by their respective networks.

WQED 13 is the local PBS member station in Pittsburgh. It was established on April 1, 1954, and was the first community-sponsored television station and the fifth public station in the United States. The station has produced much original content for PBS, including Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, several National Geographic specials, and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?[243]

A wide variety of radio stations serve the Pittsburgh market. The first was KDKA 1020 AM, also the world's first commercially licensed radio station, which began airing on November 2, 1920.[244] Other stations include KQV 1410 AM (news), WBGG 970 AM (sports), KDKA-FM 93.7 FM (sports), WKST-FM 96.1 FM (Top 40), WAMO-AM 660 AM and 107.3 FM (urban contemporary) WBZZ 100.7 FM (adult contemporary), WDVE 102.5 FM (album rock), WPGB 104.7 FM (Country), and WXDX 105.9 FM (modern rock). There are also three public radio stations in the area: WESA 90.5 FM (National Public Radio affiliate), WQED 89.3 FM (classical), and WYEP 91.3 FM (adult alternative). Three non-commercial stations are run by Carnegie Mellon University (WRCT 88.3 FM), the University of Pittsburgh (WPTS 92.1 FM), and Point Park University (WPPJ 670 AM).

Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit.[245] According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including The Mothman Prophecies, Wonder Boys,[246] Dogma,[246] Hoffa, The Silence of the Lambs,[246] Sudden Death, Flashdance,[246] Southpaw, Striking Distance, Mrs. Soffel, Jack Reacher, Inspector Gadget, The Next Three Days, The Perks of Being a Wallflower,[246] Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and Fences.[246][247] Pittsburgh became "Gotham City" in 2011 during filming of The Dark Knight Rises.[147] George A. Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his Living Dead series.[248] From 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh welcomed a series of major film and television productions like Fences, Mindhunter, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Sweet Girl, and I'm Your Woman, significantly contributing to the local economy.[249][250]

Film production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007.[251][252] The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.[253] Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them.[252]

Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include the Three Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.[254][255] The local film schools include Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Point Park University - Cinema & Digital Arts, and University of Pittsburgh - Film Studies.[256][257]

Moreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.[258][259][260][261][262] There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at the Carrie Furnace site in Rankin and Swissvale.[263]

The city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by George Westinghouse.[264] Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[265] and Pennsylvania American Water. Natural gas is provided by Equitable Gas, Columbia Gas, Dominion Resources, Direct Energy, and Novec.[266]

The two largest area health care providers are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (since 1893) and Allegheny Health Network (since 1882). Both hospitals annually rank as among the best overall in the United States, with UPMC ranked among U.S. News & World Report's "Honor Roll" every year since 2000.[citation needed]

The first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[267] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first "Mercy Hospital".[268] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[26] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[269]

In 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.08 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[270] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[271] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($660 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[272] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[273]

The $80 million ($146 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($53.3 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($227 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($699 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[citation needed]

In 2009, the $600 million ($876 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[274] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[275] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[276]

While he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955.

UPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[277] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[278][279]

The Lancet published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[280]

Pittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[281] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title "City of Bridges".[282] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The southwestern "entrance" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[283]

Pittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 minutes, while 23% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction.[284]

Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the "parkways." Interstate 376 is both the "parkway east" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the "parkway west" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The "parkway north" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The "crosstown" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped "beltway" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.

Pittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh.

Other airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh).

Amtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the Capitol Limited between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvanian to New York City.

Megabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[285]

Until declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station.

Pittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[286] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an "incline") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[287] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[288] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.

The Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the "T") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.

Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865, Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works, which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.

Pittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has major operations around Pittsburgh.

The Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011. The port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[289]

Pittsburgh's sister cities are:[290]



=== History of Pittsburgh - Wikipedia ===

The history of Pittsburgh began with centuries of Native American civilization in the modern Pittsburgh region, known as Jaödeogë’ in the Seneca language.[1] Eventually, European explorers encountered the strategic confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio, which leads to the Mississippi River. The area became a battleground when France and Great Britain fought for control in the 1750s. When the British were victorious, the French ceded control of territories east of the Mississippi.

Following American independence in 1783, the village around Fort Pitt continued to grow.  The region saw the short-lived Whiskey Rebellion, when farmers rebelled against federal taxes on whiskey. The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.  By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing large quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass products. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh had grown to be one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. Production of steel began in 1875. During the 1877 railway riots it was the site of the most violence and damage in any city affected by the nationwide strikes of that summer. Workers protested against cuts in wages, burning down buildings at the railyards, including 100 train engines and more than 1,000 cars. Forty men were killed, most of them strikers. By 1911, Pittsburgh was producing half the nation's steel.

Pittsburgh was a Republican party stronghold until 1932. The soaring unemployment of the Great Depression, the New Deal relief programs and the rise of powerful labor unions in the 1930s turned the city into a liberal stronghold of the New Deal Coalition under powerful Democratic mayors. In World War II, it was the center of the "Arsenal of Democracy", producing munitions for the Allied war effort as prosperity returned.

Following World War II, Pittsburgh launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance". The industrial base continued to expand through the 1960s, but after 1970 foreign competition led to the collapse of the steel industry, with massive layoffs and mill closures. Top corporate headquarters moved out in the 1980s. In 2007 the city lost its status as a major transportation hub. The population of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area is holding steady at 2.4 million; 65% of its residents are of European descent and 35% are minorities.

For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date.[2] During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.[3]

By 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds.  Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south.[4] With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.[5]

In 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29 km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.[6]

Shannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.[7]: 289

Sawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs.[8] Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300–400 residents.[9]

The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.[10]
Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km) wagon road to the Monongahela River[11] employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Michael Cresap to begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail[12] now known as Nemacolin's Trail. The river crossing and flats at Redstone creek, was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified as Fort Burd (now Brownsville) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock's Road a few years later through present-day New Stanton. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track.

The nearby Native American community of Logstown was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley.[6] Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region.[12] De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory.[13]

In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, an advance party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road through the woods and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.[14]

Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley, Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw.[15] Accompanied by Christopher Gist, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753.

As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, & the Land in the Fork, which I think extremely well situated for a Fort; as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 feet (7.6 m) above the common Surface of the Water; & a considerable Bottom of flat well timber'd Land all around it, very convenient for Building.

Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddie's letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and then Fort Le Boeuf. The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw.[15]

Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation[17] at the site of present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne.[14][15]

Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner.[18] After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chief Tanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity. These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), or, the Seven Years' War, a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres.[15][19]

In 1755, the Braddock Expedition was launched, accompanied by Virginia militia officer George Washington. Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountains. Braddock's Road, as it was known, blazed the way for the future National Road (US40). The expedition crossed the Monongahela River on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition at Braddock's Field, nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne.[20] In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded.[21] The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.[15]

On September 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning, and in the summer of 1758, British Army officer John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne.[21] At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford, from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13–14, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne.[21] The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers, "Pittsborough" (see Etymology of Pittsburgh).[11][15] The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification.[11] The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat.[15] They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River.

In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the "lower town", near the fort's ramparts, and the "upper town", along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.[21][22]: 148

After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War. The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts.[11] Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months.[15] Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763.[21] They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run.[21] This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains.[15]

The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown.[21] European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English-American, another third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others.[23] These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles.[23] Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.[4]

Increasing violence, especially by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.[4]

With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.[4]

After the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.[24]

The village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.[25]

Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.[20]

The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment.[26] During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square.[11] In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.[27]

Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.[11]

The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture.[11] In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products.[11] When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.[32]

Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the "City of bridges" over its two rivers.[citation needed] On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia. In 1834, the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.[27]

Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high.[33]

Like many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure.[34] Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages.[31] As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side).[27] In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.

Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:[31]

The iron and steel industry developed rapidly after 1830 and became one of the dominant factors in industrial America by the 1860s.

Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was "largely Scotch Irish". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and "developed their own sense of uniqueness."[36]

New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813–1908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806–1882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the "Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society."[37]

In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.[33] Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21" gun.[38] By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.[39]

Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Charles M. Schwab, and George Westinghouse built their fortunes in Pittsburgh.  George Westinghouse's  advancements included the air brake and was the founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886).[40][41] Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. Pittsburgh bankers including Andrew W. Mellon, with T. Mellon & Sons Bank founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.[39]

Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.[42]

Beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.[43]

Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995).  Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.[44]

A further example of a community planned to serve a particular industrial enterprise was Wilmerding in the Turtle Creek valley.   It was developed to host the workers of the Westinghouse Air Brake company and others nearby.[45]

By about 1910, the companies of George Westinghouse and Andrew Carnegie were widely distributed in the Pittsburgh region.   Their locations, and the locations of several other major industrial enterprises, are numbered in the image and are itemized here:[46]

Christopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.[47]

During the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages,[48] but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.[49]

As a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots.[50] Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.

In 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when Carnegie Steel Company's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike.  Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression, as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organized H.J. Heinz workers, with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance.

Andrew Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland and a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced.[51] He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.[39]

The third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations.[27] In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.[27]

By 1911, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial and commercial powerhouse:[21]

During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption.[52][53] Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption.[53] The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.

During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries.[53][54] Even the term "Speakeasy", meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.[53][55]

The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s.[56] In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.[56]

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.[57]

During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.[58]

In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.[59]

To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed "Millionaire's Row" because of the many mansions lining the street.

On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.[60]

Oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning.[61] It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.[39]

Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households.[62] The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.[39]

The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.[63][64]
Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:

The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:

The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District. It became  an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s.[39]

Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s,[67] and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.[68][69]

Joseph Guffey, statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only "a challenge" but also "an opportunity". He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage.[70]

Pittsburgh was at the center of the "Arsenal of Democracy" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.[11]

David Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963.[71] Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.[72]  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.[73]

Rich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the "Smoky City", with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day[11] as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.  Civic leaders, notably Mayor David L. Lawrence, elected in 1945, Richard K. Mellon, chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin[74][75] began smoke control and urban revitalization, also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city[11] in unforeseen ways.

"Renaissance I" began in 1946.  Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin.  By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal.[27]

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961.[76] Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.

In the early 1960s, the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51 km2) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district.  In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979.

Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans.  The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage, including the Mexican War Streets, Allegheny West, and Manchester, were spared. The center of Allegheny City, with its culturally and socially important buildings, was not as lucky. All of the buildings, with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office, the Carnegie Library, and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the "pedestrianized" Allegheny Center Mall and apartments.

The city's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era[77] partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC.[78][79] Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s.[11] 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium.[27] In 1974, with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed.[80] Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.

Like most major cities, Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968. There were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods.[81]

During the 1970s and 1980s, the U.S. steel industry came under increasing pressure from foreign competition and from American mini-mills constructed inexpensively using salvaged steel.[citation needed] Manufacture in Germany and Japan was booming. Foreign mills and factories, built with the latest technology, benefited from lower labor costs and powerful government-corporate partnerships, allowing them to capture increasing market shares of steel and steel products. Separately, demand for steel softened due to recessions, the 1973 oil crisis, and increasing use of other materials.[11][82]  The era began with the RIDC's "Building on Basics" report in 1974.[83]

Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable "mini-mills" and non-union mills with lower labor costs.[82]

Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S.[84] Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers.[82] The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed.[85][86] The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs.[87] Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.[88]

In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.

Top corporate headquarters such as Gulf Oil (1985), Koppers (1987), Westinghouse (1996) and Rockwell International (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the "brain drain") as well as massive charitable contributions by the "home based" companies to local cultural and educational institutions.  At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier.  Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day.

Today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the Edgar Thomson Works in nearby Braddock.

Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings, The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University.  Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.[89]  Other regional collegiate institutions include Robert Morris University, Chatham University, Carlow University,  Point Park University, La Roche College, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and the Community College of Allegheny County.

Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (26,000 employees) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System (13,000 employees).[90][91]

Despite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued.  In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation (Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies.  Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a 1-mile (1.6 km) long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh.  In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.  Aided by an initial generous gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River, opposite the Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh). Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people – teachers, students, adults, and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.[92]

During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.

In 1985, the J & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon.[27] In the 1980s, the "Renaissance II" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as PPG Place. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared.[27] In 1992, the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened.[27] In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park, despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League.[93]

Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.[94]

Present-day Pittsburgh, with a diversified economy, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for medicine and  education and culture, has been ranked as one of the World's Most Livable Cities.[95] Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities.  Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry.[96] Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook, and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh.  As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies.  The region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center.  In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants, including from the Indian sub-continent. It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt.[97]

TAX COMPUTATIONS  FOR  FREE  ADMISSIONS  – if persons are admitted free to any place  of amusement  at a time and under  circumstances  for which  an established  price  is charged  to other  persons,  the tax imposed  herein  shall be computed  on the established  price  charged  to other  persons  for the same  or similar  accommodations,  to be paid by the person  so admitted.  If persons  are admitted  at a reduced  rate, the tax imposed  shall be computed  on the reduced  rate paid.    However,  children  under  twelve  (12) years  of age, disabled  veterans  and members  of the armed  services  when  on active  duty and in uniform,  who are admitted  free of charge  to any place  of amusement,  shall not be required  to pay the tax imposed  by this Chapter.

d. TAX ON BOXES  OR OTHER  SEATING  – for persons  having  the permanent  use or lease  of boxes  or seats  in any place  of amusement,  the tax imposed  shall be computed  on the price  or rental  charged  for boxes  or seats  in the place  of 12  amusement, the tax  to be paid by the holder or lessee.

Where  any amusement  (entertainment)  is conducted  at a place  where  food and drink  are served  and there  is no fixed  charge  for admission,  the Amusement  Tax will be based  on 10% of the total amount  paid for food and drink.  For example,  if a check  for food and drink  by a party  of four amounts to $80.00,  the admission  charge  is 10% of  the total check,  or $8.00.

$8.00  admission  charge  X 5% = $ .40 Amusement  Tax.

2. If a cover  is required,  such  charge  shall be considered  as the regular established  price  paid for admission  and is taxable  as such.  If a total bill exceeds the cover charge, the total charge is taxable if it in fact represents  a charge  for admission.  If the same  charge  is made  to the person using or furnishing his own property  or equipment  as where  property  or equipment is furnished by the management, such charge is an amount  paid for admission and subject  to tax. If a lesser  charge  is made  to persons who  do not desire  to use the property  or services  offered,  the lesser  charge  represents the 3. Donations  and contributions  are taxable  as admission  charges  when  the amount  of the donation  and contributions  are stated  and when  such donations  or contributions  entitle  the donor  or contributors  to attend  or engage f. TAX ON FREE  OR REDUCED  ADMISSION 1. A bona  fide employee  of the management  of the theatre  or other  places,  is not liable  for the tax if admitted  free, but if admitted  at a reduced  rate, is liable  for the tax on the reduced  price.   Bona  fide employees  are: (a) Those  persons,  including  directors  and officers,  regularly  employed by the proprietor  of the place  or attraction  or regularly  engaged  in work  or business  transacted  there,  whether  their duties  require admission  to the place  or not, and whether  on duty at the time admitted (b) Other  persons  whose  admission  to the place  is required  for the performance  of some  duty to, or work for, the proprietor.

2. Newspaper  reporters,  photographers,  radio  announcers,  inspectors  and persons  of similar  vocation  who are admitted  free to any place  for the performance  of special  duties  in connection  with an event  and whose  special duties  are the sole reason  for their presence  and given  free admission,  are not liable  for any tax on admission.  Free admissions  granted  to such  persons who are not admitted  solely  for the purpose  of performing their  special  duties in connection  with the event  are subject  to the tax equivalent  to the tax on the admission  charge  paid by other  persons  for the same or similar 13  3. The tax imposed  upon  such  free or reduced  admissions  shall be paid and collected  at the time such  persons  are admitted.  In the event  that tickets  or cards  of admission  to the particular  performance  are not issued  but admission  is secured  by the presentation  of a life, annual,  season,  weekly, or daily pass,  the Producer  shall keep  a record  of such  admission  and the date upon  which  such  privilege  was exercised.

3. In the case  of subscription  tickets  the tax is levied  on the value  of the ticket acquired  and not on any contribution  made  by the purchaser.

COLLECTION AT SOURCE SECTION  301 – COLLECTION  AND  PAYMENT  OF TAX a. PRODUCERS  – Producers  shall collect  the tax imposed  herein  and shall be liable  to the City’s  agents  thereof  for the payment  of the same  to the City. If, however,  any Producer  fails to make  any report  or payment  as herein  required, an additional  five (5%)  percent  of the amount  of the tax shall be added  by the Treasurer  and collected  as a penalty  for each  month  or fraction  thereof  during which  the tax remains  unpaid,  together  with interest  at the rate set forth in Chapter  209 of the Pittsburgh  Code. (Ord. 38 -1991, eff 11 -25-91).

b.

SEASON  TICKETS  – where  patrons  have  the use of boxes  or seats  pursuant  to section  241.04(c)  of the Pittsburgh  Code  and are required  to pay the entire season  price  at the time the seating  is acquired,  the Producer  shall collect  the tax imposed  herein  and remit  it at the time the reservation  of the seating  is made  by the patron,  that is, in advance  of the season’s  amusement.

d. MONTHLY  REPORT  – every  Producer , except  as hereinafter  provided,  conducting a place  of amusement,  on or before  the fifteenth  day of each  month,  shall transmit on a form prescribed  by the Treasurer,  a report  under  oath or affirmation  of the amount  of tax collected  during  the preceding  month.  (Ord.  38- 1991, eff.11 - e. PERFORMANCE  REPORT  – every  Producer  conducting  a temporary  place  of amusement  or itinerant  form of amusement  shall file a report  promptly  after each performance  with the Treasurer  or his/her  duly authorized  agent.  The conclusion  of a performance  is construed  to mean  the time when  the box office  sales  are f. TAX DUE  DATE  – the amount  of all taxes  imposed  under  the provisions  of the Chapter  241 shall for places  of permanent  amusement  be payable  on the fifteenth day of the next succeeding  month,  and shall for temporary  or itinerant  forms  of amusement  be due and payable  on the day such  reports  are required  to be made under this section. (Ord.  38-1991,  eff. 11-25-91).

g. When  the City of Pittsburgh’s  Amusement  Tax is included  in the total collections from patrons , the formula  for the Amusement  Tax is: 1.00 admission  charge  + .05 tax rate 1.05 admission  charge  + tax rate The Amusement Tax is deemed included in the Established Price charged the patron if the Producer does not  separately state the Amusement Tax on any ticket or receipt as required by Section 303 , or if no receipt or ticket is issued to the patron.

A = .05 tax rate      X $20.00  Total 1.00 admission  charge  + .05 tax rate A = .05 tax rate      X $20.00  Total 1.05 admission  charge  + tax rate A = .04762  X $20.00  Total Total  admission  charge  is $20.00  x .04762  = $ .95 tax or $19.05  – Admission  Charge $ .95 tax = 5% of admission  charge  before  taxes $20.00  – Total  (Admission  Charge  + Amusement  Tax) SECTION  302 – RECORDS In general  each  place  of amusement  must  maintain  complete  and accurate  records  of all transactions,  the total amount  of consideration  received  from all transactions  and the total amount  of tax collected  on the basis  of such  considerations.  Records  to be kept must consist  of, but are not limited  to a monthly  summary  showing  the starting  and ending ticket  numbers  for each  series,  the number  of tickets  sold at each  representative  price  and the amount  of tax collected.

Where  an amusement  is included  in the price  of food and drink  the place  of amusement shall total the amount  of sales,  on the cash  register,  prior to the amusement.  The place  of amusement  shall begin  a new cash  register  tape that will end when  the place  of amusement  ends.  If the place  of amusement  does  not do this it will pay on the 24 hour period  of the day that the amusement  occurred.  Once  the total sales  have  been calculated  from the place  of amusement,  the admission  charge  equals  the amount  paid for food and drink  times  ten percent.  The imputed  Amusement  Tax equals  the admission charge  times  five percent.

16  The amount paid for food and drink  x 10% = THE ADMISSION  CHARGE The admission  charge  x 5% = THE IMPUTED  AMUSEMENT  TAX Records  to be kept shall include  part of each  serial  numbered  ticket  used  at each  place  of amusement  issued  to each  patron  and copies  of all leases  or contracts  or agreements supporting  the transactions  for permanent  use of boxes  or seats  in any place  of SECTION  303 - TICKET  LABELING a. DELINEATING  THE AMUSEMENT  TAX – for each  admission  subject  to the collection  of a tax pursuant  to the provisions  of Chapter  241, the Producer  shall cause  to be printed  clearly  on the face of any ticket,  receipt  or any other  token purchased  by a patron  for the purpose  of admission  to an amusement  the following 1. The established  price  of admission; 2. The amount  of amusement  tax due on line 1; and 3. The sum of lines 1 and 2.

b. SIGNS  – every  place  of amusement  must  maintain,  conspicuously  posted  at the entrance,  and near the box-office  a place  at which  the established  price  is paid, one (1) or more signs accurately stating: 1. The established  price  of admission; 2. The amount  of amusement  tax due on line 1; and 3. The sum total of the established  price  and the tax.

FAILURE  TO COMPLY  – in the event  that a Producer  fails to comply  with the ticketing and labeling  provisions  of Section  241.07(a)  the Producer  shall be subject  to the suspension  and/or  revocation  of his amusement  permit  pursuant  to section  241.03(c)  of the Pittsburgh Code. (Ord. 34-1994,  eff. 12-30-94).  The failure to comply with the ticketing and labeling provisions will not excuse the Producer  from timely remitt ing the deemed collected Amusement Tax.

SECTION  304 – AMUSEMENT  TAX QUESTIONS  AND  ANSWERS Q. – Are admissions  to a movie  theater  not taxed if provided by an  Institution  of Purely Public  Charity?  Is a movie theater  considered  a Performing  Art?

A. – No.  Admissions to a movie theater are not considered a Performing Art because it is not a live performance , and nor would they be considered an Exempt Performing Arts Q. – Does  a Producer of home  builders’  show s, trade shows,  or similar exhibitions  have  to collect the Amusement  Tax?

A. – The admission  receipts  from a home  builders’  show  are properly  subject  to the Amusement  Tax. The Amusement  Tax Chapter  241 of the Pittsburgh  Code  extends,  by 17  definition  to trade  shows  and similar  exhibitions.

Q. – Does  a Producer of wine tasting, beer tasting, whisky tasting, food tasting or similar events have  to collect the Amusement  Tax?

A. – The admission  receipts  from a tasting event are properly  subject  to the Amusement Tax, if the event is primarily intended to showcase a commercial product  or products , even if no live entertainment or recreation is provided.  However, if the Producer does not provide entertainment or recreation, but does collect sales taxes or drin k taxes, based on the admission charge or contribution, from the patron, then the event is an Exempt Amusement.

A tasting event is not an Exempt Amusement even if historical or educ ational material is provided to the patron if such historical or educational material is not the primary purpose Q. – A bar with entertainment  has a cover  charge  of $10.00  with the Amusement  Tax included.  How much  is the Amusement  Tax?

A. - $10.00  cover  charge  X .04762  = $0.48 Amusement  Tax.

Q. – A bar with entertainment  has no cover  charge,  is any Amusement  Tax owed?  If so, how is it calculated?

A. – The Amusement  Tax is owed.  The cover  charge  shall be imputed  per the City Code.

The amount  paid for admission  to the amusement  shall be ten (10%)  percent  of the amount  paid for refreshment,  service  and merchandise.  (The food and drink  for a bar).

The place  of amusement  must  begin  a new cash  register  tape that will end when  the place  of amusement  ends.  Once  you have  the total sales  from the place  of amusement you are ready  to impute  the admission  charge.

The amount  paid for food and drink  X 10% = the admission  charge.  The admission  charge X 5% = the imputed  amusement tax.

An imputed  admission  charge  is implied,  and the tax will be collected.  An implied  charge is one that the place  of amusement  would  normally  collect.  The admission  charge  is therefore  imputed  and the tax paid by the place  of amusement.

SECTION  401 – POWERS  AND  DUTIES  OF TREASURER  (DIRECTOR) a. It shall be the duty of the Treasurer  to collect  and receive  the taxes,  fines,  and penalties  imposed  by the City Code,  Title Two,  Article  VII, Chapter  241.

Every  Producer  or supposed  Producer , is hereby  directed  and required  to give to the Treasurer,  or to any agent  designated  by him/her,  the means, facilities  and opportunity  for such  examinations  and investigations,  as are hereby b. If records  are not available  in the City of Pittsburgh  to support the returns which were filed or which  should  have  been  filed,  the Producer  will be required  to make  them available  to the Treasurer  either  by producing  them  in a City of Pittsburgh  location  or by paying  for the expenses  incurred  by the Treasurer  in traveling  to the place  where the records  are regularly  kept.

c. Any information  gained  by the Treasurer,  by designated  agents,  or by any other official  or agent  of the City of Pittsburgh,  as a result  of any declarations,  returns, investigations,  hearings  or verifications  required  or authorized  by the City Code, shall be confidential  except  for official  purposes  and shall not be released  except  in accordance  with a proper  judicial  order,  or as otherwise  provided  by law.

SECTION  403 – RECORDS  TO BE KEPT  BY THE PRODUCER Producers  who collect  the Amusement  Tax are required  to keep  such  records  as will enable the filing of true and accurate  returns  of the tax and such  records  shall be preserved  for a period  of not less than three (3)  years  from the filing date or due date whichever  is later in order  to enable  the Treasurer  or any agent  designated  by him/her  to verify  the correctness 19  of the declarations  or returns  filed.

SECTION  404 – AUDITS If, as a result  of an examination  conducted by the Treasurer, a return  is found  to be incorrect, the Treasurer  is authorized  to assess  and collect  any underpayments  of the Amusement Tax.  If no return  has been  filed and a tax is found  to be due, the tax actually  due may be assessed  and collected  with or without  the formality  of obtaining  a return  from the producer .

Deficiency  assessments  (i.e., where  producer  has filed a return  but is found  to owe additional  tax) shall include  taxes  for up to three (3) years  prior to the date when  the deficiency  is assessed.  Where no return  was filed,  there  shall be no limit to the period  of SUITS  FOR TAX COLLECTIONS, VIOLATIONS,  FINES, INTEREST & SECTION  501 – REMEDIES  NOT MUTUALLY  EXCLUSIVE The remedies  provided  in Section  502 or Section  505 are not mutually  exclusive.   The utilization  by the Treasurer  of one remedy  does  not preclude  utilization  of the other.

Moreover, use of either or both of the remedies  provided in  these  Sections  does  not preclude  the use by the City of Pittsburgh  of any other  legal or administrative procedure which  can bring  about  compliance  by the Producer  with the provisions  of Chapter  241 of the Pittsburgh  Code  and these regulations.

Once it has been determined that that a Producer  owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all actions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional information, auditing Producer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of the tax, or obtaining liens on the Producer ’s property, wage attachments, levies, and seizures and sales of the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer may enter  into a written agreement with the Producer for payment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer may also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek cri minal charges in appropriate circumstances.

SECTION  502 – SUITS  FOR  RECOVERY  OF UNPAID  TAXES The Treasurer  may sue in the name of the City of  Pittsburgh, in law or in equity, for the recovery  of those  taxes  due and unpaid  under  the provisions  of the Amusement  Tax, to compel  the production  of records  or to enforce  any other  provisions  of the law.  Such suits may also be brought against Responsible Persons.

SECTION  503 - LIMITATIONS a. The following  periods  of limitations  shall apply  to suits for collection  of taxes.

1. When  a return  has been  filed but no tax paid,  any suit brought  to recover  the tax due and unpaid  shall be filed within  three  (3) years  after the return  was due or filed,  whichever  is later.  Where  no return  was filed,  there  shall be no limit to file suit for the collection of taxes.

2. In the case  of a deficiency  assessment,  suit shall be filed within  three  (3) years after the assessment has been made.

SECTION  504 – PENALTY  AND  INTEREST a. Producers  must  collect  the tax imposed  herein  and shall be liable  to the City of Pittsburgh  for the payment  of the tax. If, however,  any Producer  shall fail to make any report  and payment  as herein  required  a penalty  at the rate of five (5%)  percent per month  for each  month  or a fraction  of a whole  month  on the amount  of tax and interest  of one (1%)  percent  per month  for each  month  or fraction  of a whole  month during  the period  in which  the tax remains  unpaid  shall be added  to the tax.

Where  suit is brought  for the recovery  of such  tax, the person  liable  therefore  shall, in addition,  be liable  for the costs  of collection  and the interest  and penalties  herein imposed.  Once  due and owing,  penalty  and interest  become  part of the tax and shall be collected  as such.  A person’s  belief  that no tax is due and owing,  or the failure  of any person  to receive  or obtain  the forms  required  for making  the returns required  under  the City Code  is not a valid defense  to the imposition  of penalties herein  for violation.   Good  faith shall not be a defense  to the imposition  of penalty.

3. Each  and every  day that the violation  continues  shall constitute  a separate  offense for which  a fine may be imposed.

SECTION  506 – PERSONAL LIABILITY OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONS Because the Amusement Tax is collected from Patrons, the Amusement Tax is not the property of the Producer but instead is held in trust for the benefit of the City.  Any Amusement Tax collected from patrons or deemed included in the Established Price paid by Patrons shall be considered trust fund taxes  held for the benefit of the City .  Should the Producer fail to timely remit the Amusement Tax due to the City, the Treasurer may assess and collect any unpaid Amusement Tax directly from any Responsible Person  or from the Producer, or both .  A Responsible  Person can show he is not liable for any collected Amusement Tax if he shows the Amusement T ax has been properly refunded to the Patron s who paid the tax .  If the Producer uses trust fund taxes to pay a lawful obligation of the Producer, the payee of such  funds shall not be considered a Respo nsible Person, unless the payee acts in bad faith or has direct knowledge of the breach of trust.

If there are multiple Responsible Persons for a Producer, each Responsible Person shall have joint and several liabili ty for the unremitted Amusement Tax.  However, in no event may the Treasurer collect more from the Responsible Persons and the Producer in total than the Producer owes the City.

Only the Amusement Tax shall be considered a trust fund asset.  Penalties and  interest assessed against the Provider, as opposed penalties and interest assessed against the Responsible Person directly, shall not be consider trust funds monies.

In an Article VI action, a  Responsible Person shall not be able to challenge the Amuse ment Tax calculation derived from an assessment against the Producer once that assessment against the Producer has become final.

SECTION  601 – TREASURER  (DIRECTOR)  HEARINGS Any taxpayer , Producer, or Responsible Person  aggrieved by  an assessment  by the Treasurer  shall,  within  ninety  (90) days  after the date of notice  of the assessment,  request a Treasurer’s  Hearing  on a form obtained  from the Treasurer  for that purpose.  53 Pa.C.S. § 8431.

2. The petitioner’s account and/or social security number.

-4-  DRAWING ACCOUNT – a temporary capital account, set up in the name of a Partner  or Self - employed  person  from which the individual can withdraw money or other assets in anticipation of profit  of the business.

I rrespective of the common law tests for determining the existence of an independent contractor relationship, an individual performing work or service for Compensation shall be deemed to be an Employee of the person for whom the work or service is performed unless: (1) such i ndividual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such work or service, under his/her appointment of contract of hire or apprenticeship; (2) such work or service is outside the usual course of the business of  the person for which such service is performed; or, (3) such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, business or profession.   A Partner or Self - employed person is not an Employee.

EMPLOYER – any person conduct ing Business within the City .  An Exempt Employer is not an Employer under these regulations.   A Partnership is an Employer a s to its Employees and as to any of its Partners providing service in the City.  A Partner, conducting one or more business es within the City through a Partnership , where the Partnership  does not file a Payroll Tax return with the City, is an Employer.   Any Self -Employed Person conducting one or more Business within the City is an Employer.

Any person who is classified as an em ployer under the Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax statute is an Employer under these regulations. 72 P.S. § 7301 (h).  The term Employer includes any person that makes an election under 26 U.S.C. § 3504 to act as a payroll agent , or any person who  both with holds and  remits the City local earned income tax, 53 P.S. § 6924.501 , or the City local services tax, 53 P.S. § 6924.301.1(9) (v), on behalf of another.   53 P.S. § 6924.303(j).   To decide issues involving joint employers, the City will look to the guidance  provided under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 C.F.R. § 791.2 ( 85 FR 2820 , effective March 16, 2020 ).

For example, a payroll reporting company that is not a common law employer of the workers of another unless it is: (a) an employer of those workers under 72 P.S. § 7301(h) or (b) the joint employer of th ose workers.

EXEMPT EMPLOYER  – any person that is a Governmental Entity .  A contractor or consultant , classified as a Partner , a Self -employed person,  or a person receiving Form 1099 -MISC, providing services to an Exempt Employer is not itself exempt  merely because he or she derives service revenue from a Governmental Entity .

GUARANTEED PAYMENTS  – payments to Partners by the Partnership for services that are determined without regard to th e net income of the Partnership.  For example, health insurance premiums paid by the Partnership on behalf of any Partner are Guaranteed Payments because they are determined without regard to the net income of the Partnership.

-5-  GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY  – any ag ency, authority, department, or instrumentality of the federal government or of another State, and any unit of government listed under 1 01 Pa. Code INTERNAL REVENUE CODE – the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Public Law 99 - 514), as amended , 26 U.S.C. § 1, and following, as it was in effect on January 1, 20 20.  Any citation to regulations issued under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 C.F.R. § 1, and following, refers to the regulations in effect on January 1, 20 20.

NET DISTRIBUTION – the am ount of a Partner’s or Self -employed person’s draws from net income from one or more Business es that have activities in the City shall be reported for the Payroll Expense Tax.   For purposes of this regulation,  TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS  are limited by the sum of draws or net income for that Partner  or Self -employed person , whichever is less.

If the Partner’s or Self -Employed person’s Net Distribution exceeds that individual ’s share of net profit s from a particular Business , the excess draw is a return of capita l. A return of capital is not taxable because this is a liquidation of a Partner’s or Self-employed person’s assets by the owner .  A Partner’s Taxable Distribution s shall include a partner’s share of Guaranteed Payments from the Partnership.   Taxable Distr ibutions shall be determined using the same tax accounting method used to report taxable income for Pennsylvania Personal Income Tax purposes, Tax Reform Code of 1971.   Taxable Distributions from a Business are presumed to be derived from the current year’ s net income of that Business.

PARTNER  – an individual owner or member in a Partnership.   A Partner will owe tax based on Taxable Distributions.  A Partner is not taxed on his or her Passive Income.

PARTNERSHIP – an unincorporated entity, joint venture, business trust, general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, syndicate, or any other unincorporated association , with two or more owners that is taxed for Pennsylvania state income purposes as a pass -through entity.   Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7401 (definition of a “Corporation”).

An unincorporated entity , with one owner,  that is treated under the federal “check -the-box” as a disregarded entity is not a Partnership.  26 C.F.R. § 301.7701 -3 (as it was in effect on January 1, 2 020).  See, Tax Reform Act of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7307.21.   An unincorporated entity, with one or more owners, that has made the federal “check -the-box” election to be taxed as a “corporation” is not a Partnership but it may be an Employer.

PASSIVE INCOME  – Items of i ncome earned by a Partner or Self -employed person from interest  (not derived from working capital investments) , dividends, capital  gains  (except for an individual who is considered a trader and not an investor) , ground rents, royalties associated with the development of natural resources  through a non -operating interest , retirement income earned after retirement, and real estate rental income where substantial services are not provided to tenants , is non-taxable Passive Income.  In determining whet her any portion of net profits from a Business may constitute Compensation or non -taxable Passive Income, the Treasurer will follow the guidance issued under Tax Refo rm Code of 1971, 72 P.S. § 7303 (a), and the PA Personal Income Tax Return Guide, except wh ere such guidance is inconsistent with the purposes of the Payroll Tax .  Income earned by a Partner  or by a Self -employed person , is not Passive Income if the business provides professional services (e.g. law, accounting, architectural, professional engine ering, actuarial, or medical services) or personal services to customers, unless the Partner or Self -Employed person is retired , based on age or years of service,  and does not provide services to the business .  Guaranteed Payments made to a Partner are not  Passive Income.   Payments made to a retiring Partner under Section 736 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 736, are Passive Income.   The Passive Income -6-  exclusion only applies to Partners and Self -employed persons, but not to Employees whose Compensa tion is reported to the taxing authorities on a Form W -2 or Form 1099 -MISC.

PAYROLL EXPENSE – the total Compensation paid, including salaries, wages, net distributions, commissions, bonuses, stock options and other compensation to all individuals who duri ng any tax year, perform work or render services in whole or in part in the City of Pittsburgh. Employee contributions and deductions resulting from an employee election, whether deferred or otherwise, to qualified cash or deferred arrangements, such as an Internal Revenue Code Section 401( k) retirement plan or Internal Revenue Code Section 125 “cafeteria plan” , do not reduce total Compensation . Compensation meeting the definition of earned income would be part of the Payroll Expense Tax  associated with a  particular Employee  who is not a Partner or a Self -employed person .  Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.501 (“Earned Income”).  The Payroll Tax is on gross payroll  of the Employer .  The Employers’ portions of federal and state payroll taxes, health insu rance  premiums , retirement plan contributions , etc., are not  part of taxable  gross payroll.

The Payroll Expense of a Partner or Self -employed person is the cumulative annual  Taxable Distributions associated with each separate Business  carried on w ithin the Ci ty rather than “Earned Income” as defined in 53 P.S. § 6924.501.

PERSON – a corporation, Partnership, Partner, Self-employed individual, business trust, association, unincorporated entity, estate, trust, foundation or natural person. Whenever used in any provision prescribing a fine or penalty the word “person” as applied to Partnerships, shall mean  the Partners thereof, and as applied to corporations and unincorporated associations, shall mean the officers thereof.   A Governmental Entity  is not a Pe rson.

SELF -EMPLOYED  – an individual  who earns  Compensation from one or more separate Business es carried on within the City , other than as an Employee or as a Partner.  The single member owner of a n unincorporated entity that is treated as disregarded entity under the federal “check -the-box” regulations, 26 C.F.R. § 301.7701 -3 (as it was in effect on January 1, 2020), is treated as Self -Employed and not as a Partner.  The Compensation of a Self- employ ed individual shall be that person’s Taxable Distributions from each separate business reported on Schedules C, E, or F of the Pennsylvania individual income tax Form PA -40, as well as any other non-employee Compensation , which is not otherwise reported on  Schedules C, E, or F.  Passive Income  of a Self -employed person is not subject to the Payroll Tax .  If the Self-Employed person does not keep records of Taxable Distrib utions, the entire net income of each separate Business  is presumed to be a Taxable Dis tribution.  Any individual who is classified as an Employee, because of the control exercised by the Employer, is not Self - Employed as to any Compensation associated with that particular Business.

TAX YEAR – a twelve -month period from January 1 to December 31.

TAXPAYER – a person, partnership, association, corporation, or other entity required hereunder to file a return of payroll expense, or to pay a tax thereon.  An Employer , Partner,  or Self Employed person are a Taxpayer.   An Exempt Employer is not a Taxpayer.

Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.303( a).

e. Employers who have payroll expense consisting of work done within and outside of the boundaries of the City of Pittsburgh , but who do not regularly maintain records showing hours worked so as to be able to use the apportionment method under subsection (d) of this regulation,  may use a representative test period or conduct a survey based on factual data to arrive at a formula with which to calculate the percentage of payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh. Any formula so established will be subject to review and correction by the City of Pittsburgh. A thorough description explaining the formula shall be attached to the first return each year. The data supporting the formula shall be maintained for at least three (3) years as a part of offi ce records for audit and f. Partners and Self -Employed individuals who have Taxable Distributions generated from intrastate sales or services partly within the City of Pittsburgh or partly outside the City of Pittsburgh shall report on the  Taxable Distributions  associated with sales or services rendered within the City of Pittsburgh. Where it is impractical to determine the exact Taxable Distributions , an apportionment formula may be used. Any formula so established will be subject to review a nd correction by the City of Pittsburgh Finance Department. The data supporting the formula must be maintained as a part of office records for audit and review purposes. A thorough description explaining the formula shall be attached to the first return ea ch year. The data supporting the formula shall be maintained for at least three  (3) years as a part of office records for audit and review g. Partners and Self -employed individuals who have Compensation from sources within and without Pennsylvania , may apportion their Compensation to the City using the formula used reporting personal income tax on Form PA -40, 61 Pa. Code § 109.5, by substituting the  word  “City” for the “Commonwealth”  where necessary.

In the event that a person who discontinues Business during any tax quarter does so before payment of the tax becomes due for such tax quarter, said person may apportion the tax and pay an amount to be computed by multiplying the Payroll Expense for the preceding tax quarter by a fraction whose numerator shall be the number of days such person was in Business during the current tax quarter and whose deno minator shall be the total number of days in the current quarter. The final return shall be due ten (10) days after the discontinuation of Business.

(b) Any receipts arising from Institutional on non -profit service to the general public or any select or limited number thereof, is taxable if a charge is made.   Intrastate receipts from services which are the result of business activities carried on through a branch office located outs ide Pittsburgh, are taxable if such services are performed in Pittsburgh  if the service is offered from the City .

(c) Persons engaging in any Institutional or non -profit service be it professional, commercial , or personal services, are subject to the  tax. If a  person engaging in any Institutional or non -profit service only maintains a place of business in the City of Pittsburgh, the entire receipts from intrastate activity  in the Commonwealth from personal services must be included in the measure of the tax, wh ether or not the services are performed in Pittsburgh. Receipts will be deemed attributable to Pittsburgh, if they result from the efforts of employees who work in,  or from or are attached to taxpayer's Pittsburgh place of business.   If any taxpayer is subject to Privilege tax in two or more jurisdictions in Pennsylvania, he may request a ruling from the Treasurer  to address the issue of potential double taxation .

(d) Receipts associated with interstate commerce shall be apportioned to the City by multiplying total receipts earned everywhere times the City Apportionment percentage.  The City Apportionment percentage  is the sum of the following three apportionment factors:  Payroll  Percentage factor , Property  Percentage factor , and Sales Percentage  factor , divided by three . If one of the percentage factors is zero, the denominator shall be two.  If two of the percentage factors are zero, the dominator shall be one.   In no event can a percentage factor be less than zero.

(1) The Payroll Percentage factor  shall be payroll reported by the taxpayer subject to City local earned income tax divided by total payroll reported on Federal Form 940.  If the taxpayer only has one office in the Commonwealth and that office is in the City, the numerator  of the Payroll percentage factor shall be total payroll reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.

(2) The Property Percentage factor  shall be the sum of tangible property located in the Cit y divided by the sum of tangible property located everywhere in the United States, determined as of December 31 .  Property shall be recorded at its original cost before any depreciation , amortization, or cost depletion .  Leased property -14-shall be recorded as an item of tangible property at eight  (8) times annual rent  for the leased property .  Movable property is in the City if it is in the City on December 31 of the calendar year.   If the taxpayer only has one office in the Commonwealth and that office is in the City, the numerator of the Property pe rcentage factor shall be sum of tangible property located in the Commonwealth.

(3) The Sales Percentage factor  shall be gross receipts from Services provided in the  City or offered from a City location divided by gross receipts everywhere.   If additional guidance is required with regard to the definition of Sales, the taxpayer shall follow the practice of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue under the Corporate Net Income Tax provisions of the Tax Reform Act, 72 P.S. § 7401, so long as such pr actice is not inconsistent with the purposes of the Privilege Tax.

(4) A taxpayer is engaged in interstate commerce if it is subject to tax in another jurisdiction , outside the Commonwealth,  on its net income or on its gross receipts.   A taxpayer can show it is subject to tax in another jurisdiction by providing copies of tax returns  filed with taxing jurisdictions outside the Commonwealth.   If intrastate receipts are co -mingled with interstate activity, all receipts shall be considered interstate receipts.

(5) If the application of the City apportionment percentage  results in the same gross receipts of the Taxpayer being taxable , for gross receipts or privilege tax purposes,  by two or more jurisdictions  in the United States , the Taxpayer may approach the Treasurer  for a ruling  to avoid this double taxation, such as receiving a credit for gross receipts or privilege taxes paid  elsewhere , or by a modification of the City apportionment percentage.   No credit will be granted by the City for net income taxes , excise taxes,  or transaction taxes  paid to another jurisdiction.

Once due and owing, penalty and interest become part of the tax and shall be collected as such. A person’s belief that no tax is due and owing, or the failure of any person to receive or obtain the forms required for making the returns required under the City Code is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties herein for violation.

-6-  EXAMPLES FOR LOCAL SERVICE TAX (LST) 1. How is the LST deducted from the employee’s pay and remitted to the City? Example, employees work full time in the City and all employees earn $12,000 or more.  What is the employer’s  responsibility?

ANSWER:  The employer is required to withhold the pro -rata share of the tax by dividing $52 by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year.

The $52 tax would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly or at $4.33 per month for taxpayers paid monthly. When calculat ing the pro -rata share, employers are required to round down to the nearest one -hundredth of a dollar.

The employer must remit the LST quarterly. The LST form is provided by the City. The tax should be paid the month following the end of each quarter. The  LST forms can be downloaded  at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance 2. At the beginning of the year, an employee expects to earn a total of $10,000 in the City for the entire  calendar  year.  Should  the employer  withhold  the LST?

ANSWER: No. If an employee files an exemption certificate with his employer stating that he will earn less than $12,000 for the entire year, the employer is not required to withhold the LST.  The employer is required to have the exemption certificate available for employees to  complete.

The exemption certificate can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/fin ance 3. A new hire files an exemption certificate with his employer. The employer and his employee realize with 13 weeks left in the year that he will earn $12,000 because he is working more hours than anticipated. He is paid weekly. Is his employer responsib le for withholding the LST now?

ANSWER: Yes. After the employer realizes that the employee will  earn  $12,000  or more, the employer must withhold $40 ($39 + $1) from the next pay to catch -up then $1.00 a pay for the remaining 12 pays for a grand total of  $52.

4. Employee has two part -time jobs; one located in the City which pays him $8,000 a year and another in Municipality “A” that pays him $7,000 a year. Does this person need to ANSWER: No.  The taxpayer should file an exemption certificate w ith both employers and have  no LST deducted.  The Taxpayer  is not subject  to the LST since  he did not earn $12,000 in any single municipality. If the tax was withheld the employee could file a refund claim with each municipality after January 31 of the following year. The refund request form can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance  - the form is listed  as LST REFUND  FORM.

5. An individual works January thru June in the City and July thru December in Municipality “A”. He earns $10,000 a month at both jobs and is paid once a week. What is his liability ANSWER: His employer in the City should withhold $1 a week for 26 pay periods and remit $26 along with his other employees’ deductions to the City. Municipality “A” would be entitled to the LST for the 2nd half of the year. The emp loyee should provide proof of LST paid for the first half of the year to Municipality “A”.

-7-  6. An individual works July thru December in the City. He did not work January thru June, anywhere. He earns $10,000 a month. Does he owe the $52 LST to t he City?

ANSWER: Yes. His employer knows that this employee is over  the  $12,000  low income exemption level. No exemption certificate has been filed. The $52 may be prorated for the rest of the year; however the employer should withhold $52 because that is what  the employee  owes.

SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the prior periods that were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current payroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid once a week, h e would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be deducted from one paycheck.

7. An employee has 2 jobs and both are part time. Both started at the beginning of January.

Job #1 is in the City and pays the employee $1,000 a month. Job #2 is in Municipality “A” and paid the taxpayer $500. Where should the tax be  paid?

ANSWER: Since both jobs started at the same time, the job that pays the employee the most should be considered his principal job and in this case it would be the City. The LST shoul d be paid to the City. The employee should file an exemption certificate with Municipality “A” or proof that his principal employer is located in the City.

8. On January 1, an employee worked for an employer in Municipality “A” and paid $10. In June the emplo yee started a new job in the City and will make over $12,000 at this job.

Is the employer  required  to withhold  the LST from the employee?

ANSWER: Yes. The employer must still withhold $42 ($52 less $ 10 previously paid) if the employee provides proof that the $10 was paid to Municipality “A”. Then the employer must pro -rate the $42  based on the remaining payroll  periods.

SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the prior periods that  were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current payroll deduction that he and his co -workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid once a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be deducted from one p aycheck.

9. An employee files his exemption certificate late. The employer has already withheld $52.

Can the employee  apply  for a refund?

ANSWER: Yes. The employee should request the refund from the employer. It is permissible and recommended that his employe r refund the current year LST and make an adjustment for their next quarterly remittance to the City for the current year.

Any taxes deducted and withheld from employees, plus any penalties and interest thereon, constitute a  trust fund for the benefit of the City. The failure to timely remit such funds allows the City to collect such trust funds from the employer, the employer’s representative, or any other person receiving such trust funds.  53 P.S. § 6924.705(b)(1).

The failure or omission of any employer to make the correct deductions required by this section shall not relieve any employee from the payment of the tax or the balance determined to be due, together with penalty and interest from the date the tax was due , or from complying with the requirements of the Code relating to the filing of declarations and returns.

-10-  ARTICLE  3: IMPOSITION  OF TAX § 301.  RATE  OF TAX.

(a) Rate  of tax. A tax for general  revenue  purposes  is hereby  imposed  upon  each parking  transaction  by a patron  of a non-residential  parking  place  at the rate of thirty -seven  and one-half (37.5)  percent  for all transactions  occurring  on or after January  1, 2009.  The rate of tax may be changed  for any tax year by the legislative  actions  of the Mayor and City Council.   However, the tax rate may not exceed the rate permitted by the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act , 53 P.S. § 895.902.

(b) Calculation  of tax. The following  method  must  be used  to compute  the tax, whether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where individual  tax collections  are not kept for each  ticket : Simplified Calculation .  For ease of administration and tax collection,  the tax return presumes that gross collections include both total consideration from the patron and collected parking tax  from the patron . Under this simplified calculation the applicable tax rates is 27.273% times gross collections.

The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as follows: Parking  Fee X Tax Rate  = Parking  Tax Due For example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%: $1,000.00  X 37.5%  = $375.00 $1,550.00  X 37.5%  = $581.25 (c) Calculation  of total  payment.  The following  method  shall be used  to compute the total payment  collected  by the  operator  and paid by the  patron,  whether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are not kept for each  ticket.  The rate of tax is defined  above  and will be applied  as Parking  Fee + Parking  Tax = Total  Payment For example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%: $1,000.00  + $375.00  = $1,375.00 $1,550.00  + $581.25  = $2,131.25 (d) Calculation  of total  payment where  there  is a surcharge.  The following method shall be used  to compute  the total payment  collected  by the operator  and paid by the patron  when  a surcharge  is imposed,  whether  the tax total is taken  from individual  cash  register  tapes  or where  individual  collections  are not kept for each ticket.  The parking  tax will be applied  to the sum of the base  parking  fee and the surcharge.  The rate of  tax is defined above  and will be applied  as follows: -11-  (Base  Fee + Surcharge)   + Tax Rate(Base Fee  + Surcharge) = Total  Payment For example,  where  the tax rate is 37.5%  and the surcharge  is $10: ($1,000.00  + $10.00)  + $378.75  = $1,388.75 ($1,550.00  + $10.00)  + $585.00  = $2,145.00 § 302.

The Smiley :-) was created by Carnegie Mellon research professor Scott Fahlman on September 19, 1982. This was the beginning of emoticons in email, and the precursor to emojis.

Carnegie Mellon alumnus Andy Warhol was an iconic figure in the pop art movement that explored the relationship of art to modern celebrity culture and advertising. His work included hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film and music. A pioneer in computer-generated art, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.

It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts. The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named "Win-Win: How to Get What You Want," started with Carnegie Mellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful — and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject: Women Don't Ask and Ask for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want.

In 1979, Carnegie Mellon established the nation's first Robotics Institute. Since then, professor and alumnus William "Red" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to clean up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race. Technologies like these can help make driving safer by preventing accidents.

The Mayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote. City Council’s nine representatives are elected to office by residents in each of their respective districts.

The Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or fraudulent practices. Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with reporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City’s fiscal condition. Every year, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information on Pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook.

City Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also approves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital Budgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of City government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.

City Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk. The City Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information resource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget Division monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations.  It prepares and distributes to Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City of Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special reports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.

The Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly responsible for much of the City’s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices, Bureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to debt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law acts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella organizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire, Emergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and Safety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations, Environmental Services, and Facilities.

Additionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City’s managerial hierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City’s General Fund. For this reason, these Authorities are not included in the Operating Budget.

A comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart presented in this document. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide What is the Operating Budget?

The Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are figures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are spread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the administration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public safety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and programming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the routine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’ compensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.

The City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are collected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses, charges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other revenue generating mechanisms.

The Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what governmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal year. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in delivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.

The Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and Members of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the City of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of Pittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire through tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must prioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the City. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits priorities set by the City’s elected public officials.

Finally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the City of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating Budget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial creation of the plan.

The General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh recognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.

The City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of each year. This can only be changed by ordinance.

Balanced Budget Mandate The City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues equal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year, the budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide The City’s Fund Structure In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City’s financial reporting system is organized on a fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.

Capital Projects Fund Community Development Funds Special Revenues Funds The General Fund  is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain most of the City’s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general The Capital Projects Fund  is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or program (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to provide a long-term benefit to the City. All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum value of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from three major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on the Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 Capital Budget document.

Community Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and human services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.

Special Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or committed for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership Fund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for two of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word “trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the funds are not held by any trustees or custodians.

Fiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These resources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh’s own operations and are custodial in nature. The City’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.

• The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for firefighters, and a third for municipal employees.

• Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax refunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other Post-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of This budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that comprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide The City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and Elected Office. These accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the Fund ...Cost Center ...Subclass ...Object Account The legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101.

Annual City of Pittsburgh revenue is generated by both tax and non-tax sources. There are seven subclasses.

42  License and Permit Revenue 43  Charges for Services 44  Fines and Forfeitures 45  Intergovernmental Revenue 46  Interest Earnings 47  Miscellaneous Revenues Taxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues. In addition to wage and property taxes, there are many that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City.

They are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.

Real estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School District, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within the City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property Assessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2023, the City real estate tax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax rate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny County Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).

Other sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax, the Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the Deed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax.

Earned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2 percent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security, and capital gains are commonly excluded.

The Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh’s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied at the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed individuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide services within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide Finally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of Pittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051.

In 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76.5 percent of total City revenue.

City of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for the improvement of the City's parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Stop the Violence Trust Fund  section for more information.

“Non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not directly involve the levying of taxes. Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction permits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as interest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.

Each year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of grants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account consists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most intergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. Local entities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal agencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the quality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden.

Many City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. Examples of these fees include payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale of rights of way. In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and governmental entities. For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to receive medical care.

In 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23.5 percent of total City revenue.

How Does the City Spend Money?

The tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents ranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. Expenditures are monitored by department or division and by subclass.

Major expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for City of Pittsburgh employees. The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past and current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. The chart below illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB) contributions, health insurance and workers’ compensation.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide $ (Millions)Select Major Expenditures, 2018-2022 2021 2022Health Insurance Workers' CompensationPension and OPEBDebt Service050,000,000100,000,000150,000,000 These expenditures are categorized within the Personnel – Employment Benefits subclass.

Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of Finance and is composed of the following accounts: 82101  Interest Expense - Bonds Budget Creation Process The operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations, policy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by After receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit proposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements, requests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the proposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if any, should be funded.

The Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to garner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor’s strategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.

City Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After consideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a vote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st.  Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of the new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to collective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before December 31st was 1931.

Upon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating and Capital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City’s expenditures and revenues, provides legislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments.

Analysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure categories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important management initiatives.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide Five-Year Financial Forecast In addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both expenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise the five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.

The five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This aids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long- term impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for long-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might result in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus ensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.

Revenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and deliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the rights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

Projected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.

The Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts.

Previous years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of- year financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue line. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.

In addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic variables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue generating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the National Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.

Revenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are developed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are reasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections are finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.

Expenditure Forecast OMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these forecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known expenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension contributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).

OMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and initiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are subject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This is accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend, Lastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described above. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in achieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests and evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that fall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide How to Read the Budget Throughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. In general, each separate section of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference between each report within a section.

Departmental Sections The most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in the Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been appropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the Departmental Sections of the Operating Budget. City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide The organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau, or Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with the exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions.

Departmental Overview At the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the organization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the department. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency, Bureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed.

The position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or “FTE,” represents the number of full-time workers in the position. The “Rate/Grade” category indicates how an employee’s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees can be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a “12” in the “Hours/Months” column indicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or ending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The “Budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The “Vacancy Allowance” adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions throughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons.

This portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass and object account level. For example, the general “Professional and Technical Services” subclass will highlight the appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as “Administrative Fees,” “Workforce Training,” and “Computer Maintenance.” Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted expenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024 Under the Personnel – Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular  salary represents the total base pay for the organization. Longevity  pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining agreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances  are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or seasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform  allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs are listed accordingly. Leave Buyback  represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the City. Premium Pay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements  are funds from outside sources that are used to offset certain position expenses.

Finally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to the 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. The percent change from the prior year is included as a reference point.

Note for Fund Accounts For special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2024 summary is composed of the “Projected Beginning Balance” for January 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and the “Projected Ending Balance” for December 31, 2024. These funds carry over from year to year.

Five-Year Expenditure Forecast The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan submitted by the City highlights the Mayor's commitment to financial sustainability, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations, and strengthening financial management practices. The City plans to achieve these by: • Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services • Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations • Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and provide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases • Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary The 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and improve the City’s long-term fiscal health by: • Allocating an additional $243 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated minimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC) • Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 10.1 percent of General Fund expenditures in 2024 • Allocating a $22.0 million in "pay-as-you-go" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan In addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key components and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following: • Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase workplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost management initiative.

• Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees, workers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer contributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few years, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Fiscal Year 2024 Expenditures health and managing costs. Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension funding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.

• Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required costs that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across • Debt Service: The forecast assumes that with the significant reduction in debt service that occurred in 2019, the City will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the City’s critical infrastructure • PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the Capital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the City spends on capital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2024 Capital Improvement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement, economic development, and blight remediation. The forecast assumes that the City will continue to contribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing $22 million in 2024 and a total of $21.1 million from 2025 to 2028.

Most non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout fiscal year 2028. Debt Service will decrease significantly in 2027.

Each Member represents one Council District, and is appointed to be the chairperson of a committee which corresponds to one or more City Departments. Council carries out duties in accordance with the Home Rule Charter and the laws of the state, and is primarily responsible for making laws which govern the City of Pittsburgh. City Council proposes, debates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also approves appointments as provided by the Charter, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final operating and capital budgets for the City.

Council members also introduce ordinances and resolutions which directly address policy and City Council is entrusted with the review and approval of all City laws. Council members interact with City Departments, other units of government, and the general public as a means to obtain information pertinent to their decision-making process.City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget   City Council Districts Fiscal Year 2024  101100 2023 Rate/ Hours/ 2023 2024 Rate/ Hours/ 2024 Title FTE Grade Months Budget FTE Grade Months Budget Member of Council  9  81,137  12 $ 730,233  9  83,571  12 $ 752,139 Council Staff  23 varies  12  1,317,542  28 varies  12  1,619,997 Total Full-Time Permanent Positions  32 $ 2,047,775  37 $ 2,372,136 Temporary, Part-Time, and Seasonal Allowances Administrative/Research  — varies  — $ 257,455  — varies  — $ — Total Full-Time Permanent Positions  32 $ 2,047,775  37 $ 2,372,136 Temporary, Part-Time, and Seasonal Allowances  —  257,455  — Vacancy Allowance  —  —  —  — Total Full-Time Positions and Net Salaries  32 $ 2,305,230  37 $ 2,372,136 The salary of elected city officials is statutorily set by the City's Home Rule Charter, Section 310 (h).

Departmental/Bureau Overview The Bureau of EMS provides advanced life support, pre-hospital care, and transportation for the sick and injured through the deployment of thirteen advanced life support ambulances, each staffed by Pennsylvania Department of Health Certified Paramedics. In addition to the advanced life support units the bureau also staffs four basic life support ambulances staffed by Pennsylvania Department of Health Certified Emergency Medical Technicians.

Strategically located throughout the City, the Bureau will operate thirteen advanced life support (ALS) and three basic life support (BLS) ambulances 24 hours per day when at full staffing capacity.

With advanced training and technology, the Bureau of EMS is delivering cutting-edge care by providing new treatment modalities that allow for more effective recognition and treatment of heart attacks, strokes, cardiac arrest, and a number of other life threatening conditions. For patients experiencing ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), EMS has the ability to screen and directly transmit an EKG to the receiving hospital and activate the cardiac cauterization laboratory prior to arrival, greatly reducing the time to definitive treatment.

The Bureau of EMS also provides integrated medically-directed rescue for vehicle accidents, industrial accidents, high and low angle rope rescues, confined space emergencies, building collapse, elevator emergencies, and others. The base service is comprised of two specially equipped rescue trucks, each staffed by two paramedics, operating 24 hours a day. All Pittsburgh Paramedics are trained and certified for vehicle and basic rescue practices. Those paramedics assigned to the Rescue Division receive additional rescue training and certifications.

The Bureau of EMS is also an integral part of three joint public safety teams: River Rescue, SWAT, and the Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Team. For each team, EMS provides an administrative and leadership role as well as a cadre of highly qualified personnel and instructors.

For River Rescue, EMS provides two Paramedic Public Safety SCUBA divers to staff the units. The Bureau of Police assigns an officer/helmsman who provides a law enforcement component to the units. This unit conducts port security and safety patrols on a routine basis.

For the SWAT Team, EMS provides trained Tactical EMS (TEMS) personnel who have undergone all of the required SWAT training in addition to specialized treatment under fire training. They respond as an integral element of the SWAT Team to multiple incidents such as barricaded persons, high risk warrants, and dignitary For the Hazmat Team, EMS participates with the Bureaus of Fire and Police, providing personnel trained and certified to the Technician level for entry, evaluation, mitigation, and decontamination. EMS also provides the required medical monitoring for pre-entry and post-entry for an incident.

The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire encourages all personnel to take a proactive role in reducing the impact from emergencies by providing programs related to fire prevention, public education, community relations, risk reduction, disaster planning, homeland security, and operational training. All services provided to the residents and visitors of the City of Pittsburgh, the County of Allegheny, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be delivered in the most professional manner, to the best of our ability.

Departmental/Bureau Overview The roles and responsibilities of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire as related to public safety include emergency medical care, fire investigation, code enforcement, training, logistics, and suppression. Suppression and emergency medical services are the largest functional area in terms of responsibility and resources. The suppression function is the activity of containing and extinguishing a fire. The goals of the suppression division are to protect lives, property and the environment. The PBF expanded its emergency medical service capabilities by becoming a licensed emergency medical care provider issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The Bureau provides these services through the following four divisions: Administration - Provides managerial and administrative services for the Bureau.  This activity includes budget and finance; payroll; employee relations, strategic planning; record and data gathering, facility and fleet Operations - Provides emergency incident response to protect the lives and property of city residents and visitors. In addition to extinguishing fires, controlling hazardous material emergency incidents, flood response, and emergency management, the personnel in this service area are responsible for providing emergency medical care to sick and injured individuals. The Fire Bureau responds to approximately 20,000 emergency medical calls each Planning and Training - Provides training, communications, and logistics for the Bureau of Fire. The Training Academy implements employee development programs for fire suppression personnel. The programs consist of fire suppression, apparatus driving operations, emergency medical responder, hazardous material, technical rescue, vehicle rescue, and disaster response topics. The PBF expanded its role in disaster preparedness and response, which includes increased capabilities to provide swift-water rescue, as well as taking a proactive role in planning and preparation for a disaster involving crude oil being transported by rail through the City of Pittsburgh, and other transportation emergencies. All new recruits must complete 32 weeks of basic training before being assigned to a permanent station within the PBF. In addition to recruit training, continuing education is required for all members of the PBF. The Bureau also provides public education to various community organizations and City programs such as the Civic Leadership Academy.

Risk Management - Enforces the City’s hazardous material code, the International Fire Code, investigates complaints of life-threatening and unsafe conditions, and conducts fire investigations.

Departmental/Bureau Overview The Office of Community Health and Safety is focused on building a response continuum and developing sustainable upstream interventions to address unmet community social service needs that often fall to Public Safety personnel, who represent the 24/7 safety net response.  Through partnerships and program development, the Office will focus on: Developing a Continuum of Support:  Through continued collaboration with first responders and community members, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and evaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will establish a continuum of resources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public Safety partners.  First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis will be utilized to build this continuum.

Implementation of Public Health-Informed Practices:  Public Safety personnel consistently respond to community needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders have significant exposure to issues that affect community members’ health and well-being.  OCH&S will work with the Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and responses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by community members.  Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate translational experiences.

Consistent Community Engagement and Partnership:  Continued community engagement, transparency, and accountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the current response continuum.  OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth.  OCH&S will partner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and may not engage in traditional meetings.  Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism.

Note: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.

Specifically, we strive to: • Create a vibrant community that provides older adults with the social, emotional, and physical resources necessary to be able to stay safe in their home and community.

• Ensure that Pittsburgh’s children & youth have equitable access to quality educational and recreational enrichment opportunities to help them thrive as they enter adulthood.

• Utilize our park assets to offer community wide programs and events that strive to be accessible and welcoming to residents and visitors of all ages.

Departmental/Bureau Overview The Department of Parks and Recreation accomplishes this mission through four core program areas that are supported by an operations and administrative team. The Operations and Administration division has direct oversight over fiscal and HR processes, planning for capital improvement projects, delivery of new programs and initiatives, and the management of all departmental budgets and trust funds. A critical focus of the Operations and Administration division is to coordinate with other City departments, the Office of the Mayor, City Council, and external partners to ensure effective, efficient, and impactful delivery of programs to the public.

Our four core program areas include: Recreation Programs – The Recreation Programs division is committed to providing opportunities for residents and nonresidents of all ages to participate in directed recreational, educational, and enrichment-focused programs and activities. This area includes the operation of our recreation centers and fitness gyms, organized Citisports/ sports programming, activities at the Schenley Ice Rink and Mellon Tennis Center, and the implementation of summer and after-school youth camps and programs. The recreation system has a specific focus on providing services to families and opportunities for Pittsburgh’s youth to have a safe and enriching place during out of Senior and Wellness Programs – Citiparks operates thirteen Healthy Active Living Centers which are focused on improving the physical, intellectual, social, cultural, and financial health and interests of older residents. The senior program partners with other area agencies in delivering quality health and wellness programs, and works to address the needs of individuals as they age. In addition, this division oversees the City of Pittsburgh’s commitment to nutrition support for city residents through the management of food programs for youth and older adults, the City’s Farmers Markets, City Farms, and the newly created Pittsburgh Food Justice Fund.

Community Programs – Community programs and events are focused on activating our park and recreation spaces to engage city residents in a whole host of enriching experiences. Our office of Special Events is charged with hosting movies, music, races, and other key city events including the 4th of July and Light Up Night.  Our Community Enrichment team operates the Roving Art Cart, participates in special recreational programs, partners with PPS Schools, and organizes and plans annual premier celebrations like Alphabet Trail & Tales and Track n' Treat. A  specific focus of this program area is the Rec2Tech initiative. This program focuses on the development and delivery of technology focused programs, coding, and other tech-adjacent learning initiatives.

Aquatics Programs – The aquatics division is responsible for providing city residents with access to safe pools and aquatic activity year-round. The aquatics division operates 18 City of Pittsburgh pools and 9 spray parks during the summer months. In the off season the aquatics team operates the Oliver Bath House, scheduled to complete renovation in fall of 2024, and partners with Pittsburgh Public Schools to host swim opportunities and lifeguard trainings for Pittsburgh youth that may be interesting in becoming a part of the City’s aquatics team. In addition to staffing the pools for open swim, the aquatics team offers learn to swim, water aerobics, and swim team programming throughout the summer months.

The broad mandate of the Citizen Police Review Board is to provide independent review of the conduct of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.  To accomplish this assignment, the Board will thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations; evaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices through public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor and Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.

A Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the staff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.

Departmental/Bureau Overview Investigation and Complaint Disposition  - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the CPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake Coordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of the complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the complaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a preliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides daily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and the results are presented to the Board.  The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an investigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through investigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion.  Findings and recommendations resulting from public hearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board.  Patterns emerging from complaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy recommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.

Community Education  - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens and police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and civilian expectations of police conduct.  Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and personal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s role and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the public is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen and the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as offensive.  The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the process, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.

Board and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance, including police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human rights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior.  Staff training is designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops mediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. Staff adheres to the standards and performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.

The mission of the Grants Office is to increase the City’s capacity to compete for federal, state, county, corporate, and foundation grants and to effectively assist in the full life-cycle of grant management from award through closeout. The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City’s exposure to any grant-related legal liability, and improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.

The Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to expand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City’s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant funds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our community. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain technological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed throughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services, recreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows the City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the impact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.
