The Frick Pittsburgh is committed to better serving our communityâ€”visitors, staff, artists, scholars, educational partners, and neighbors. The Frick will be an anti-racist, welcoming multicultural organization, a place where all can have authentic experiences with art, history, and nature.

The Frick Pittsburgh occupies ancestral lands of the Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Osage, and Shawnee peoples. As a place of history and nature, the Frick recognizes the cultural importance of land and the role of cultural institutions in the formation of collective memory. Displacement and erasure are not just histories for native peoples. Land acknowledgements, like historic sites themselves, are exercises in preservation and reconciliation, engaged with past, present, and future.
