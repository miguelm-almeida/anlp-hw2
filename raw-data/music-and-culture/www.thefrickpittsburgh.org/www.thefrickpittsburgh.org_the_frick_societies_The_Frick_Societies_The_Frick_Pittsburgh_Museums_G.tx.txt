1882 is the year that Henry Clay Frick purchased the Italianate-style home we know today as Clayton, the cornerstone of the Frick’s collections. Members of the 1882 Society are, likewise, cornerstones of the vital philanthropic support necessary to advance the museum’s mission.

The Rubens Society is named after the renowned seventeenth-century Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, whose Portrait of Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency, Princess of Condé (ca. 1610) is one of the most admired works in the Frick’s collection.

Named for the enduring history of the Frick family’s Gilded Age home, the Clayton Society is composed of individuals committed to the sustainability and future of The Frick Pittsburgh. Recognized by Architectural Digest as "a triumph of restoration," Clayton is a stunning late-nineteenth-century mansion, and the only surviving example of a home on Pittsburgh’s lost "Millionaire’s Row."

The Helen Clay Frick Society honors the legacy of the Frick’s founder and benefactress. Members enjoy the distinction of being part of a vital group to support the Frick’s mission to provide memorable experiences with art, history, and nature that inspire and delight.
