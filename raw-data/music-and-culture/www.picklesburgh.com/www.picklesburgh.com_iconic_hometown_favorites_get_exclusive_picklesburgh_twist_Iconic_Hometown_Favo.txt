Voted #1 Food Festival in America for the three consecutive years, Picklesburgh provides a perfect opportunity for Pittsburgh’s most beloved local food and drink purveyors to surprise and dill-ight festival goers with pickled twists on familiar favorites. This year’s festival expands to four days (July 18 – 21) with an exclusive menu of hometown crowd pleasers from some of Pittsburgh’s most iconic and beloved breweries, bakeries and eateries including Iron Born Pizza, Hyeholde, Fl.2, Meat & Potatoes, Millie’s Ice Cream, DiAnoia’s Eatery, Yuzu and Burgatory.

A Steel City staple, Iron City Beer is thrilled to debut its newest concoction: IC Pickle! A fermented first for Picklesburgh, this exclusive pickle-flavored edition of Iron City’s popular IC Light beer was developed in collaboration with Pittsburgh Pickle Company. “The crisp taste of cucumber balanced with fresh dill makes this lager most refreshing when spending the day trying the best pickles Pittsburgh has to offer,” said Brandon Mayes, director of brewing and quality assurance. IC Pickle will be exclusively on tap at Picklesburgh and is sure to be a hit among beer and brine enthusiasts alike.

Exclusively for Picklesburgh, Turner’s will be offering a limited-edition Pickled Iced Tea! Turner’s ice-cold beverages are Pittsburgh’s favorite summer refreshment and will be offered as a special edition beverage along with classic iced teas and lemonades at multiple locations around the festival.

World-famous for their swirl bread, Jenny Lee is preparing to launch its own version of a popular pairing: grilled cheese and gherkins! Their new signature sandwich is set to become an instant Picklesburgh classic, combining two buttered-up slices of their famous Garlic & Herb savory bread with Swiss cheese and pickles from Eerie-based Flippin’ Pickles. To give back to the community, Jenny Lee’s is also presenting free kids activities during Picklesburgh at the Li’l Gherkins Kidsplay area. Thanks to Jenny Lee’s, kids will be able to create pickle shaped jewelry and puppets in conjunction with creative staff from Arts Excursions Unlimited.

As the legendary Mancini’s Bakery returns to this year’s Picklesburgh, a new creation joins last year’s sensation, the PGH Roll, made with Heinz pickle chips and Islay’s chipped ham. This year, make room for the new PGH Roll 2.0 made with Silver Star cheesy Bratwurst and pickled cabbage, fresh-baked into an Iron City Beer roll.

Those who are pining for Picklesburgh and can’t wait to placate their pickle passion can rejoice as Taste of Picklesburgh returns in a newly expanded format! This year, starting July 11 and continuing throughout the festival until July 21, over 25 Downtown restaurants and retailers will offer a creative array of pickle-inspired food and drink items, gifts, and products. Participating establishments will also distribute free Heinz Pickle Pins with purchase of pickle-themed items, while supplies last.
