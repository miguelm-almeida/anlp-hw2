A gift to Carnegie Museums is a gift to your community: to the 400,000 school kids inspired by Carnegie Museums educational programming last year; to the nearly 1 million visitors to our museums, including 50,000 ACCESS-card users who visit for as little as $1. Carnegie Museums is the region’s largest, most far-reaching cultural organization, with a legacy of scientific discovery, art exploration, and service to the community.

All gifts are important gifts. Learn more about our giving circles.
