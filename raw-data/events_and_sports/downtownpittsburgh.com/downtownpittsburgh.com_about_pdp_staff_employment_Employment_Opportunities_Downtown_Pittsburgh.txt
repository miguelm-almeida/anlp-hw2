We’re currently seeking dedicated individuals to join our Clean & Outreach Teams.

Outreach ambassadors work with individuals on the streets of Downtown, connecting them with local social service outreach programs, organizations, and helpful resources.

Clean Team members answer questions, clean up litter, and work to beautify the neighborhood.
