Tickets can be accessed digitally via the MLB Ballpark app

Group tickets are non-refundable once paid in full.

Additional tickets can be purchased at the discounted group rate, based on availability. Please note: The Pirates use a real time pricing model that more accurately reflects the demand for each game and provides fans with more price options. With advanced metrics linked to the Pirates' ticketing system, the ticket prices are adjusted upward or downward based on the demand for each game. This provides fans with greater price flexibility based on real-time market conditions.

Some ticket sections may already include loaded value which can be used to purchase concessions or merchandise the day of your game at PNC Park. Other group tickets do not have loaded value included but have the option to add it on in increments of $5.
