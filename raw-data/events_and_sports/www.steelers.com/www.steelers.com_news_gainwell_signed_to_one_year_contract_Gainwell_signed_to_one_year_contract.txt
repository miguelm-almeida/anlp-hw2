The Steelers signed running back Kenneth Gainwell to a one-year contract.

Gainwell was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL Draft, the 150th overall pick, and spent the last four seasons with the Eagles.

He has appeared in 66 games, including four starts, and carried the ball 280 times for 1,185 yards, a 4.2-yard average, and 12 touchdowns. Gainwell also has 102 receptions for 721 yards, a 7.1-yard average, and one touchdown. He also has 27 kickoff returns for 612 yards, a 22.7-yard average.

"I love the toughness of this team, the toughness of this brand of football," said Gainwell. "And really, just Coach Mike Tomlin, I grew up watching the Steelers every Sunday, seeing the Steelers on TV and that just really drew my interest.

"My brother (Kory) was a big-time fan of the Steelers. That just drew the line and got me watching the team.

"And seeing what Coach Tomlin does with the running backs, for me to come in and implement my game and be the best version of myself."

The Steelers faced Gainwell in a Week 15 matchup against the Eagles in 2024, when he rushed for 20 yards on seven carries, and had three receptions for 40 yards. He also had 63 kickoff return yards, for a total of 123 all-purpose yards in the game.

"I bring a different game," said Gainwell of his style of play. "I can run any route out of the backfield, I can do anything out of the slot, protection, run game. Pass protection is big here and that is something I bring and can be high on."

Gainwell played in all 17 games in 2024, starting one, while carrying the ball 75 times for 290 yards, a 3.9-yard average, and one touchdown. He also had 16 receptions for 116 yards, a 7.3-yard average as he helped the Eagles on special teams as well during their Super Bowl LIX season as he returned 18 kickoffs for a career-high 456 yards, a 25.3-yard average.

In 2023, he played in 16 games, with two starts, and finished the season with 84 carries for a career-high 364 yards, a 4.3-yard average, and two touchdowns. He added 30 receptions for 183 yards, a 6.1-yard average.

During the 2022 regular season he appeared in all 17 games, carrying the ball 53 times for 240 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 23 receptions for 169 yards, a 7.3-yard average. In the postseason, Gainwell led the Eagles with 33 carries for 181 yards, a 5.5-yard average, and a career-long 35-yard touchdown. He also had seven receptions for 55 yards, a 7.9-yard average, and his 236 yards from scrimmage also led the Eagles.

In 2021, he tied for the most rushing touchdowns in franchise history for a rookie with five. He finished the season with 68 rushing attempts for 291 yards, a 4.3-yard average, and 33 receptions for 253 yards, a 7.7-yard average, and one touchdown for a total of six touchdowns for the season.

Gainwell played college football at Memphis where he was a teammate of Steelers receiver Calvin Austin III. He played in 18 games at Memphis, starting 14, and had 2,212 yards from scrimmage, including 1,550 rushing yards and 662 receiving yards, with 17 touchdowns. He helped to lead Memphis to an AAC Championship in 2019 when he had an FBS-leading 2,069 all-purpose yards and 1,459 rushing yards, which ranked 12th nationally. He became the third player in Memphis history to register 2,000 plus all-purpose yards. He opted out of his final college season in 2020 after four relatives passed away due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
