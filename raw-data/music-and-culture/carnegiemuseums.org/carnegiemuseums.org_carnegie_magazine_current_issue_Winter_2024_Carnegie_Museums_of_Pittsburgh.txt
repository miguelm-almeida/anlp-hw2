A message from Steven Knapp.

Charles “Teenie” Harris was one of Pittsburgh’s most prolific chroniclers of the city’s communities and Black life in midcentury America. Now, visitors to Carnegie Museum of Art have unprecedented access to his work. A new museum gallery dedicated to Harris includes never-before-seen color photographs and moving images, as well as black-and-white photographs, film negatives, and recorded oral histories.
