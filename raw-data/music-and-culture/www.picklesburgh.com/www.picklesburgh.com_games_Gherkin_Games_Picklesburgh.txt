# Gherkin Games

# General Contest Rules & Regulations

## Pickle Juice Drinking

## Pickle Eating – New!

## Bobbing for Pickles – New!

### This year, dare dill-vils from across the land competed for a shot at gherkin glory in three heart pounding events

### Congrats to our 2024 Champions!

Preliminary heats took take place on Friday, July 19 and Saturday, July 20, culminating in championships on Sunday, July 21. The winning champion of each event relished their victory with $500 in grand prize money, a life-like pickle trophy, and—most importantly—a “royal” title fitting of their pickle prowess.

Quench your thirst for brine in this test of speed and fermented fortitude. Whoever can chug a quart (32 fl oz.) of Pittsburgh Pickle Company’s Picklexir the fastest will be deemed the winner of their round and vie for the title of Duke of Drinking in the championship on Sunday.

Only stomachs of steel will prevail in this new contest category! Whoever eats the most pickles by weight in five minutes (‘chipmunking’ is allowed) will win their round and earn a spot in the final, where the Earl of Eating, first of their name, will be crowned.

No hands are allowed in this pickled take on the peculiar party pastime. Whoever can retrieve the most pickles by weight in 90 seconds using only their mouth will win the round and face-off in the finals to become Picklesburgh’s first Baron of Bobbing!
