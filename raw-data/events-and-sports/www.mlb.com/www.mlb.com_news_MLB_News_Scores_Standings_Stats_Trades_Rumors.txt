The second edition of Spring Breakout is bursting with high-profile prospects. A whopping 69 members of MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 are slated to participate, including Red Sox outfielder Roman Anthony (No. 2), Tigers outfielder Max Clark (No. 6), Red Sox infielder Kristian Campbell (No. 7), Rays shortstop Carson Williams (No.

Spring Breakout is here! The second edition of the four-day prospect showcase kicks off Thursday.                         Last year, we had moments like Paul Skenes and Jackson Holliday going head-to-head (Skenes came out on top), Rays first baseman Xavier Isaac (MLB No. 50) and Yankees outfielder Spencer Jones slugging two homers apiece

FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Red Sox star slugger Rafael Devers has re-positioned his stance on the possibility of moving to designated hitter to make way for free-agent acquisition Alex Bregman to play third base.                         Devers indicated he had a conversation two to three weeks ago with chief baseball officer Craig

Who will be the best pitcher in each league in 2025?                         Last season, there was no question that the Tigers' Tarik Skubal and the Braves' Chris Sale surpassed every other arm. Both claimed a Triple Crown en route to winning their first Cy Young Award.

TEMPE, Ariz. -- What’s baseball without a little bit of magic?                         The Angels found out in a fun way on Wednesday when magician Shlomo Levinger visited the clubhouse to perform a set that wowed players and coaches alike. It was a way to escape the grind of Spring Training, and

Spring Breakout returns for the second season after debuting last year to much fanfare. The weekend begins with two of the most highly anticipated games on Thursday and continues through Sunday night.                         Like last year, all 30 Major League clubs will field teams of their best prospects at the showcase

CLEARWATER, Fla. – This year’s Trade Deadline will arrive on July 31, but the Braves won’t have to wait until the dog days of summer to make some impactful acquisitions.                         Atlanta will be adding a bona fide ace to its rotation when Spencer Strider returns from elbow surgery, while 2023

TOKYO -- With the upcoming Tokyo Series set to feature a pair of storied Major League franchises with plenty of talent from Japan, the Dodgers will have two of their most intriguing arms take center stage on home soil.                         Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki will start for Los Angeles when

PHOENIX -- Rule 5 Draft picks run the gamut from sleepers to stalled prospects. They can play any position. They land with clubs spanning the spectrum from rebuilders to contenders.                         But they share one thing in common: opportunity.

PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. -- The Rays announced Thursday that they will not be moving forward with their plans to build a new ballpark as part of a redeveloped Historic Gas Plant District in St. Petersburg.                         The Rays made the news official on their social media accounts with a statement from

CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Long after Zack Wheeler and Jesús Luzardo pitched a simulated game on Monday at BayCare Ballpark, Bryce Harper grabbed his first baseman’s mitt.                         A morning downpour had postponed his scheduled infield work, but he did not want to skip it. So, Phillies infield coach Bobby Dickerson hit

Just imagine what the scene will be like inside the Tokyo Dome when the Dodgers and Cubs meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to open the 2025 MLB regular season:                         More than 45,000 passionate fans in one of the world’s most baseball-obsessed countries cheering on two of the most storied franchises

During Spring Training, MLB.com beat writers surveyed their clubhouses, asking players for their opinions on a range of topics. Well over 100 players participated, in exchange for anonymity. In the leadup to Opening Day, MLB.com is publishing a series of stories based on the results of that survey.                         Today’s topic:

DUNEDIN, Fla. -- The Blue Jays can exhale. Max Scherzer’s right thumb soreness is nothing serious, an MRI has shown, and he should be back on the mound over the next day or two.                         Scherzer felt the soreness coming out of his start last weekend, so the Blue Jays were

The MLB season will get underway when the Dodgers and Cubs square off in the 2025 Tokyo Series in Japan on March 18-19.

The inaugural Spring Breakout in 2024 provided a platform for fans to meet many of baseball's top prospects before they began standing out in the Majors shortly thereafter.                         Paul Skenes striking out Jackson Holliday. Jackson Chourio reaching twice and scoring a run. Jace Jung hitting a pair of homers.

FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The Red Sox feel better about their starting pitching depth than they’ve felt in years, and it’s going to be put to the test early in the season.                         Red Sox manager Alex Cora revealed to The Boston Globe before Thursday’s game in Port St. Lucie against

Cubs outfielder Seiya Suzuki stepped into the batting cage recently to take some cuts.                         Literally.                         Ahead of next week’s Tokyo Series, the native of Japan stepped into the right-handed batter’s box wielding not a baseball bat but a SAMURAI SWORD -- and what came next was exactly what you’d expect

PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- In a vacuum, Jeff McNeil’s injury is “a minor hiccup,” as the second baseman put it -- an unfortunate case of a right oblique strain with two weeks to go until Opening Day. It should not sideline McNeil past mid-April.                         Only from a wider lens

JUPITER, Fla. -- Marlins right-hander Edward Cabrera exited 12 pitches into Thursday’s Grapefruit League start at Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium with a blister on his right middle finger.

DUNEDIN, Fla. -- Drip... Drip... Drip...                         Despite Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s wishes earlier in camp for his extension negotiations to not become a distraction, we just keep hearing about them. While Guerrero doesn’t seem distracted in the least, this remains a story that is going to hang over the Blue Jays

TOKYO -- When Luis Cruz first saw Shohei Ohtani -- then a 19-year-old in his second professional season in Japan -- the former remembers thinking, "Oh my God, this guy's going to be good."                         That said, Cruz had no idea at the time that Ohtani -- whom he thought would

It has never been done in Major League Baseball. It may well never be done in Major League Baseball. But the Kansas Jayhawks pulled off an unprecedented feat on Wednesday afternoon, hitting five consecutive home runs in their game against Minnesota.                         When grad student Jackson Hauge came to the plate

SURPRISE, Ariz. -- Bobby Witt Jr. seemed to avoid the worst after being hit by a fastball during the Royals’ 7-6 win over the Mariners on Wednesday afternoon.                         The Royals' shortstop did not suffer a fracture, the team announced, with X-rays coming back negative. He’s dealing with a left forearm
