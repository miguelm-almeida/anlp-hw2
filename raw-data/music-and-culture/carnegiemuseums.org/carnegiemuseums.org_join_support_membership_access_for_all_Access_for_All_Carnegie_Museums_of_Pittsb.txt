Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh’s Community Access Memberships represent an invitation to everyone to join us as members and enjoy the benefits of being part of the Carnegie Museums member community all year long.

For young people eager to learn and eager to be challenged and inspired by new experiences, a new FREE Teen Membership gives every young person aged 13-18 the full benefits of membership. Learn more.

For individuals and families whose barrier to accessing our museums is primarily a financial one, our $20 Family Access Membership helps remove that barrier. Learn more.

For community-based nonprofit organizations that serve underserved youth, unhoused individuals, veterans, and seniors receiving public assistance, a complimentary Organizational Outreach Membership invites these groups to become members and visit our museums at no cost, all year long, with up to 10 members of the communities they serve per visit. Learn more.
