## For You

From our two-story “Liberty Tubes” slide to the original sets and puppets from Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, the Heinz History Center is the perfect Pittsburgh place to explore with kids!

Explore Pittsburgh innovations and learn about the inventing process in Discovery Place, a kid-friendly zone where creativity, science, and history merge! Design a piece of pop art, create a rocketship and watch it fly in the wind tunnel, and build bridges using massive foam blocks in the engineering playground! As Daniel Tiger would say, “Isn’t that grr-ific?”

Serve up Isaly’s ice cream at the play soda fountain, milk a full-scale mooing cow, and zoom down a spiral slide, in Kidsburgh — our interactive, two-tier playplace for the history makers of tomorrow! Grown-ups can even keep an eye on their children from the seating area outside Kidsburgh and the cafe, thanks to a TV with a live feed of the playplace.

The Sports Museum takes kids on an epic journey through the City of Champions, from the almost-forgotten tales of Pittsburgh Olympians to the stories of Western Pa. legends like Franco, Swin, Mario, and Roberto. Throw a pass to Lynn Swann and John Stallworth, sink the winning birdie in Oakmont Country Club’s famed “church pew” bunkers, and relive the moments that make Pittsburgh sports unforgettable.

Won’t you be our neighbor? Explore the largest collection of original items from the iconic children’s television show, “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” in our Special Collections Gallery. Parents will get chills seeing familiar objects from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, including the entryway and living room set that Mister Rogers walked through to begin each show, King Friday XIII’s Castle, and the Great Oak Tree (also featured on the hit PBS cartoon, “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood”).
