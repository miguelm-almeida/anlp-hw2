Join Fort Pitt Museum for an afternoon with author C. Prentiss Orr.

The Fort Pitt Museum will host award-winning author, editor, and publisher C. Prentiss Orr to discuss his book, “The Surveyor and the Silversmith.”

Inside “The Surveyor and the Silversmith,” Orr offers a deep dive into the complex world of land speculation and surveying in the Ohio Country. Readers will learn how early surveyors and investors shaped the frontier, fueling expansion and conflict in the region.

Following the lecture, Orr will sign books for attendees. The program will take place in the Fort Pitt Auditorium on the museum’s first floor.

Orr is the principal author and editor of the popular illustrated reference book, “Pittsburgh Born, Pittsburgh Bred: 500 of the More Famous People Who Have Called Pittsburgh Home,” chosen by the Heinz History Center as the official publication to celebrate Pittsburgh’s 250th anniversary.

He has written dozens of Pittsburgh biographies as editor and publisher of Allegheny Cemetery’s Heritage newsletter and published two local history books with the late C. Hax McCullough.

Orr also was an editor of “The Power of Pittsburgh,” published by Towery Books as the centerpiece of a larger economic development campaign he directed for the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. A former theatre marketing professional and advertising creative director for more than 30 years, in 2005, Prentiss also co-founded Pennsylvania Pure Distilleries, the first vodka distillery in Pennsylvania and makers of Boyd & Blair Potato Vodka.
