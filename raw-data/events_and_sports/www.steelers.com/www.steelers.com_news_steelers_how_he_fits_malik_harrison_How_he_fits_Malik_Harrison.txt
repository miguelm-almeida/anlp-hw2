The Steelers signed former Baltimore linebacker Malik Harrison to a two-year deal in free agency.

Harrison, 27, enters his sixth NFL season as a special teams ace with starter capability.

The 6-foot-3, 255-pound Ohio State product appeared in 76 career games with the Ravens, 34 of them starts.

In 2024, the Ravens inserted Trenton Simpson into the starting lineup to replace Patrick Queen after he was signed in free agency by the Steelers.

But the defense turned around in the second half of the season when the Ravens turned to Harrison to start the final seven games. Harrison played a career-best 382 defensive snaps, helping to settle things down on the second level for the Ravens.

He finished the season with 54 tackles, two sacks and three tackles for a loss.

Harrison has the length to fill a role as a reserve edge rusher and the athleticism to play off the ball in space.

A former third-round pick, Harrison ran a 4.66-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2020, also posting a 36-inch vertical jump.

He's never played fewer than 288 snaps on special teams in his five NFL seasons and has topped 300 snaps on special teams in each of the past three seasons.

With special teams ace Tyler Matakevich an unrestricted free agent and Elandon Roberts having signed with the Raiders, Harrison would figure to slide into that role with the capability of stepping into the lineup, if necessary, as a downhill thumper.

He finished second on the Ravens with eight special teams tackles in 2024.

With the NFL toying with the idea of tweaking its kickoff rules even more â including pushing the kickoff spot back five yards â to create more kick returns in 2025, having big, fast players who can run could become critical on those units.

Harrison would fit the bill in that respect. Covering kickoffs was the one area where the Steelers struggled on special teams in 2024 as they -- and the rest of the NFL -- adjusted to the new kickoff rules.
