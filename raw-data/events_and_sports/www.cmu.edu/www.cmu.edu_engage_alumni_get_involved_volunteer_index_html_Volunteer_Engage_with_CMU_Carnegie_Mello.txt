### Why make the time to volunteer? Our current volunteers find volunteering a great way to:

Carnegie Mellon volunteers are alumni, parents, faculty, staff and friends who believe in the university’s mission and advocate for it on campus and around the world. As a CMU volunteer, you’ll be able to share your Tartan pride, enjoy new experiences, connect with old friends — and make new ones.

The CMU Alumni Association can help connect potential volunteers with opportunities that fit their skills, interests and schedule, and provide current volunteers with resources and upcoming opportunities.

Chances are, there is a time, place and CMU volunteer opportunity that matches your interests and schedule — and if there isn't, you might be able to start one.

The first step is to explore some of the options available through the Alumni Association or the colleges, departments or organizations on campus, and then get in touch.

Alumni volunteers help plan programs and events that resonate with their fellow Tartans.

Reunions: The CMU Alumni Association plans programming for the five-year reunion cycle at Spring Carnival. Reunion Ambassadors help build momentum around the tradition of celebrating reunions.

Mentorship Opportunities: Pay forward your success by offering advice through one-time connections or find long-term mentees as you share your career and life experiences and hard-won knowledge.

Virtual Programming: Volunteer to help bring CMU programming to people around the world in the virtual space.

Athletics: Support, grow and develop the Tartan athletics program.

Parent Engagement: Parents and families of current CMU students can participate in Summer Welcome events, Tartan Talks, Take a Tartan to Work and other programs.

College/School/Department: A variety of volunteer opportunities exist that support CMU’s colleges, schools and departments. Reach out to alumni-volunteer@andrew.cmu.edu and we can connect you with the volunteer manager in that area.

Prospective Students/Admissions: Assist the Office of Admission by participating in or coordinating activities for prospective students who are interested in Carnegie Mellon.

Job Posting/On-Campus Recruiting: Opportunities to share open positions and/or recruit current students and alumni to your company.

Professional Development Presenter: On-campus, regional or virtual opportunities to share your professional knowledge with current students or alumni.

Thank you for volunteering your time with Carnegie Mellon University! We want your experience to be fulfilling and fun, and we're happy to provide forms and resources that will help you succeed and get the most out of your role as a volunteer.
