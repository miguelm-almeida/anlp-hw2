Pittsburgh Opera strives for accessibility in its performances, performance spaces, communications, and at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. We have also been a leader in offering accessibility services, such as Audio Commentary and Braille program books, at performances.

Pittsburgh Opera is committed to including all staff, patrons, and volunteers in all performances and programs. We consciously use person-centered language and strive to raise awareness about positive interactions. We welcome persons with disabilities as volunteers. We aim for full participation, inclusion, and integration of people of all abilities into the fabric of the company.

All operas, including those performed in English, include Supertitles (English texts) projected onto a screen above the stage (unless otherwise noted). These are sometimes referred to as "OpTrans".

Pittsburgh Opera offers an audio description service for patrons with visual, hearing, and print impairments during most Tuesday performances at the Benedum Center, August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Pittsburgh CAPA (Creative and Performing Arts) School, and at the Bitz Opera Factory.

Audio description service is also offered at Art Song Recitals in the Bitz Opera Factory. Through Assistive Listening Devices, patrons can hear the Supertitles read simultaneously with their appearance on the screen, as well as descriptions of the set, characters, and costumes.

A volunteer team has provided the Audio Commentary service since 2003. Several team members provide individual assistance to patrons as they pick up Assistive Listening Devices. Another team member reads from the program book ten minutes before each act of the performance—the "pre-show". Another team member reads the Supertitles and describes the visual aspects of the stage—the "play-by-play".

Patrons may reserve seats in advance by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 213. Tickets are $14.00 each for patrons with visual impairments and a companion, and consideration will be given in case of financial hardship.

To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the Benedum Center, a patron presents an ID in the Guest Services Center, located off the far right lobby. To pick up an Assistive Listening Device at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, CAPA, or at the Bitz Opera Factory, a patron presents an ID at the Education table in the lobby.

Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) transmit and/or amplify the sound of a production for anyone with or without a hearing aid.

The Benedum Center has two systems for Assistive Listening: an Infrared system and an Inductive Loop system.

Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and the Bitz Opera Factory have radio systems for broadcasting audio description. These Assistive Listening Devices with radio receivers are set to the frequency of the broadcast. After patrons turn the radio on, they can adjust the volume.

Sign language interpretation can usually be arranged upon request. Requests for sign language interpreters must be received at least two weeks prior to the performance, and are subject to the availability of an interpreter.

To request an ASL interpreter at a Pittsburgh Opera performance, please email us or call 412-281-0912 x216 for details. If you have specific questions, please feel free to ask your ticketing representative or call the Benedum Center directly at 412-456-2600.

Watch the video below to learn how ASL interpreters enhance the performance for patrons, and why ASL conveys things beyond what our supertitles can do.

Large print and Braille programs are available for every performance and may be obtained in the Guest Services Center at the Benedum Center. For performances at the Pittsburgh CAPA Theater and at the Bitz Opera Factory, Braille and Large Print programs may be obtained at the Education table in the lobby.

Patrons who wish to read study guides in advance of performances may request that their email addresses be added to the Audio Commentary email updates list.

Sensory Workshops are held for select productions at the Bitz Opera Factory in the Strip. These workshops examine the story, the music, and the background of the opera. Participants will have a chance to explore the scenery, props, and costumes. Workshops are conducted by the Education Department.

Sensory Workshops are free, but reservations should be made by calling 412-281-0912, ext. 242.
