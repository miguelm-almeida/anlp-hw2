12 fixed-route public transportation agencies serve riders in the 10-county Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission region. Service is provided by bus, light rail, and incline, and most agencies provide commuter service into Downtown Pittsburgh. This Interactive Map provided by SPC shows all non-PRT transit lines serving the ten-county region.

Many regional transit agencies service regional park-n-ride facilities where motorists park their vehicles or commuters can be dropped off to board public transit vehicles or meet their carpool or vanpool group to travel to their destinations. The CommuteInfo website has detailed information on each park-n-ride facility located in the region, including physical characteristics, the transit service offered at each facility, a map, and directions to the facility.

Amtrak, the nation’s publicly funded railroad service, provides intercity passenger rail service.  Two routes – the Pennsylvanian and the Capitol Limited – service the Pittsburgh area at Downtown’s Amtrak Station. Click here for Amtrak information and schedules.

Each route provides one trip a day in each direction.  The Pennsylvanian, a part of the state-managed Keystone service, connects Pittsburgh and New York City.  The Capitol Limited, a part of Amtrak’s long route system, connects Washington and Chicago with a stop in Pittsburgh.

Based on the Amtrak website, Pennsylvanian stations available to handle checked bags and bicycles are Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Altoona, Harrisburg, Lancaster, Philadelphia, Newark, and New York.  The bicycle charge is $20.00.
