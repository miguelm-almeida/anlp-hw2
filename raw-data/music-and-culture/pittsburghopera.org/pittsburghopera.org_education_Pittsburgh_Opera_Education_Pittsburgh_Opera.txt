Opera is a multi-faceted art form, rich in fascinating history and colorful personalities. There is always something more to learn about opera, and Pittsburgh Opera provides a wide variety of programs to help you explore individual operas and the field in general.

Education Programs at Pittsburgh Opera translate this multi-disciplinary art form into relevant, engaging, and enriching experiences for educators, students, schools, families, and adults. Pittsburgh Opera’s Education programs were recognized as a finalist at the 2019 International Opera Awards. We were the only opera company from the United States among the finalists.
