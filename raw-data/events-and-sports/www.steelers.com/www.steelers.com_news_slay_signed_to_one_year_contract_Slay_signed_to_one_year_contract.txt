The Steelers signed cornerback Darius Slay to a one-year contract

Slay was originally drafted by the Detroit Lions in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft, the 36th overall selection. He spent his first seven seasons with the Lions before playing the last five seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles after he was acquired via a trade in 2020.

He was a First-Team Associated Press All-Pro selection in 2017, a six-time Pro Bowl selection (2018, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024) and a starter for the Eagles Super Bowl LIX championship team.

"It's a great opportunity here," said Slay. "I talk about Mike T(omlin) a lot. He is a coach I wanted to play for if I got a chance to. And he wins."

Slay has appeared in 177 games, starting 167. He has 614 career tackles, 512 of them solo stops, and 16 tackles for a loss. He has 28 career interceptions, three of them returned for touchdowns including a long of 70 yards, 161 passes defensed, five fumble recoveries, two forced fumbles and one sack.

His 161 passes defensed since 2013 leads all NFL players. He also has four multiple interception games.

And now he is ready to bring it to the Steelers.

"I think physicality when I hear Steelers defense," said Slay. "I am going to fit in wherever needed. Whatever the coaches need me to do, whatever they need me to do in this role, I am here to do it to the best of my ability. Whether that's leading with my play, whatever.

"This organization has been winning championships way before I won one. I just want to be here and be a sponge for guys to learn from."

Slay was a force for the Eagles Super Bowl run in 2024, starting 14 games and finishing the season with 49 tackles, 39 of them solo stops, three tackles for a loss and led the team with 13 passes defensed for the Eagles No. 1 pass defense and No. 1 overall defense.

He had his best season in 2017 in Detroit when he had a career and NFL high 26 passes defensed, while adding a career-high eight interceptions en route to All-Pro honors. He also recorded 60 tackles, 54 of them solo stops.

Slay began his college career at Itawamba Community College in Fulton, Mississippi before attending Mississippi State. He earned All-SEC honors as a senior at Mississippi State in 2012 when he recorded 40 tackles, 26 of them solo stops, with five interceptions, including one he returned for a touchdown.
