The Steelers signed linebacker Malik Harrison to a two-year contract.

Harrison was originally drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the third round of the 2020 NFL Draft, the 98th overall pick and has spent the last five seasons with the Ravens.

Harrison has appeared in 76 career games, with 35 starts. He has 144 career tackles, 78 of them solo stops, and seven tackles for a loss. He also has two sacks, four quarterback hits, and one pass defensed. He also has 30 special teams tackles, including 17 solo stops.

"It's my presence and how aggressive I am, and my versatility," said Harrison of how he fits with the Steelers defense. "I can play inside, outside. I can do it all, special teams, I'm all over the place. So that's what I think I can bring.

"Special teams, I will do anything to make this team win. Special teams is a core to this game, and I feel like it's important. You've got one play, and you've got to make that one play count."

Harrison plays with an edge, an aggressive approach that will have him fit right in with the defense.

"I think that's just always been how I played throughout college and in high school," said Harrison. "I've always just been the guy that's very aggressive, I don't shy away from contact. I feed off of contact. If somebody gets me, I'm going to have to get you back."

In 2024, he played in 15 games, with seven starts, and had a career-high 46 tackles, with 16 solo stops. He also had career-highs with two sacks, three tackles for a loss and eight special teams tackles. Harrison was part of a Ravens' defense that was ranked No. 1 against the run in 2024 (80.1 yards per game) and No. 2 in sacks (54) and fourth down efficiency (42.9%).

Harrison appeared in 14 games in 2023, starting eight. He had 17 tackles, 11 of them solo stops, and three special teams tackles. He helped the Ravens' defense achieve leading the league in scoring (16.5), sacks (60) and takeaways (31), the first unit in the NFL to lead all three categories in the same season.

In 2022 he started eight of the 17 games he appeared in, finishing with 27 tackles, including 19 solo stops, and four special teams tackles.

Harrison played in 14 games in 2021, including five starts, and also spent time on the Reserve/Non-Football Injury List. He finished the season with 18 tackles, 11 of them solo stops, and two tackles for a loss. He also blocked a fourth quarter 60-yard field goal attempt against the Cleveland Browns (10/23) to help the Ravens hold onto a 23-20 lead.

In his rookie season he played in 16 games, starting seven. He recorded 36 tackles, 21 of them solo stops, and one tackle for a loss and a pass defense. Harrison started in his first NFL game, recording four solo tackles and a pass defensed in a season-opening win against the Cleveland Browns.

He played college football at Ohio State, just 15 minutes from where he grew up in Walnut Ridge, Ohio. He recorded 205 tackles, 136 solo stops, 29 tackles for a loss, 10 sacks, nine passes defensed, three fumble recoveries and an interception in 52 games, including 28 starts. He was named first-team All-Big Ten by coaches in 2019 and third-team All-American by the Associated Press the same season.
