The Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh Carnegie Connectors membership group is for young supporters of the four Carnegie Museums — the Carnegie Museums of Art & Natural History, The Andy Warhol Museum, and Carnegie Science Center. Members of this group, ranging in age from twenty-one to forty, are culture-creators who recognize the importance of investing through their membership in the four Carnegie Museums and the city of Pittsburgh. Carnegie Connectors demonstrate an interest in arts, science, and natural history, and a drive to create a community based on these shared interests.

As a Carnegie Connectors member, you will explore and experience what makes all four Carnegie Museums destinations for art, history, and science through a dedicated calendar of programs and special events.
