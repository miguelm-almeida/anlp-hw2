Founded in 1990, the Italian American Program is dedicated to preserving and interpreting the history and culture of Italian Americans in Western Pennsylvania through exhibitions, educational programs, publications, and community outreach.

The Italian American Collection is one of the largest repositories of Italian American artifacts, photographs, oral histories, and archival materials in the United States. For over two decades, it has documented the pivotal role Italian Americans play in shaping the region’s political, economic, religious, and cultural landscapes.

For more information about the Italian American Program, please contact Melissa E. Marinaro, curator, Italian American Program at [email protected] or 412-454-6426.

The collection is grown through donations. If you are interested in donating materials, please contact Melissa E. Marinaro at [email protected] or 412-454-6426.

Learn more about contributing to the collection

Since its inception in 1990, the Italian American Program has benefited from the guidance of a community-based volunteer Advisory Council. This Council assists the collection’s curator with programming advice, the dissemination of information to the community, and the collection of materials including oral histories, documents, photographs, and artifacts.

The Italian American Advisory Council is made up of scholars, educators, executives, entrepreneurs, politicians, and community leaders.

The Italian American Bollettino is an e-communication that reports on what’s happening with the History Center’s Italian American Program. Sign up to learn about upcoming events and see highlights from the Italian American Collection.
