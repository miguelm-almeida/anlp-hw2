Take your family on a day-long adventure at Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, located in Avella, Washington County, Pa.

A National Historic Landmark, Meadowcroft features a massive rock overhang – the Rockshelter – used 19,000 years ago for shelter by the region’s first inhabitants. Take a tour of this internationally-renowned archeological treasure and learn more about the lives of Western Pennsylvania’s prehistoric hunters and gatherers.

At Meadowcroft’s interpretive villages, you can step back in time to encounter rural life over the past 500 years. Explore a wigwam and test your aim with a spear thrower at the 16th-century Eastern Woodland Indian Village, experience an 18th-century log cabin and open-sided trading post, and watch a blacksmith forge red-hot iron or take a lesson in a one-room school house at the site’s 19th-century Historic Village.

DRIVING DIRECTIONS

During Meadowcroft’s season, tours of the Rockshelter are offered daily and last approximately one hour. Times vary. Please check in at the Visitor Center to sign up for a Rockshelter tour, or call 724-587-3412 for more information.
