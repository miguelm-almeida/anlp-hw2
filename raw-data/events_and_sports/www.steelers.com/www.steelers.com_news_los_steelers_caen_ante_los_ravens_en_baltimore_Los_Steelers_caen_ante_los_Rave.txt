Los Pittsburgh Steelers perdieron 17-34 contra los Baltimore Ravens en el partido correspondiente a la semana 16 de la temporada regular de la NFL. El equipo perdiÃ3 la oportunidad de coronarse como campeÃ3n divisional, pero se mantienen como lÃ­deres del Norte de la Conferencia Americana y con un lugar en los playoffs asegurado.

"No hicimos lo necesario para obtener la victoria. Felicito a los Ravens por su desempeÃ±o y su victoria. No controlamos el juego terrestre, nunca lo hicimos y cuando no puedes hacer eso tienes que ganar el juego con cambios de posesiÃ3n y jugadas de alto impacto, pero eso tampoco lo pudimos lograr"

El no poder controlar el juego terrestre de los Ravens fue clave, Derrick Henry corriÃ3 para 162 yardas durante el partido y eso ayudÃ3 a Baltimore a controlar el partido y a desgastar a la defensiva de los Steelers.

La primera mitad fue una muy de estilo de estos partidos divisionales, rÃ­spida, competida y muy pareja, los Ravens se fueron arriba 17-10. La defensiva y los equipos especiales ya habÃ­an dado seÃ±ales buenas provocando dos balones sueltos durante los dos primeros cuartos, pero en ninguna de las ocasiones lograron recuperar el ovoide.

En los Ãoltimos cinco minutos del tercer cuarto Russell Wilson conectÃ3 con Cordarrelle Patterson, quiÃ©n en tres tiempos se llevÃ3 el pase de anotaciÃ3n con el que el juego se empatarÃ­a a 17. DespuÃ©s de eso los Ravens respondieron con siete puntos mÃ¡s.

Con el marcador 24 - 17 a favor de los locales, Minkah Fitzpatrick interceptÃ3 un pase a Lamar Jackson que reavivÃ3 las esperanzas de los Steelers de empatar el partido en el Ãoltimo cuarto pero todo eso se derrumbÃ3 dos jugadas despuÃ©s del intercambio de balÃ3n cuando Russell Wilson fue presionado, lanzÃ3 un mal pase y Marlon Humphrey completÃ3 el pick six que separÃ3 todavÃ­a mÃ¡s el marcador 31-17.

Una tarde complicada para la lÃ­nea ofensiva de Pittsburgh que permitiÃ3 3 capturas y varias jugadas forzadas por parte de Wilson debido a la presiÃ3n ejercida por la defensiva.

Justin Tucker marcÃ3 la diferencia definitiva con un gol de campo que dejÃ3 el marcador 34-17 a favor de los Ravens.

HabrÃ¡ que sacudirse esta derrota y dar la vuelta de inmediato porque el prÃ3ximo 25 de diciembre, en plena Navidad, los Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Chiefs en un juego que puede definir el orden de los playoffs en la Conferencia Americana.

Hablaremos de ese partido mÃ¡s tarde en la semana.

Con la mente en los Kansas City Chiefs.

Here we go!
