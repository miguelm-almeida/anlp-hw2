Pay tribute to a loved one or commemorate a milestone with a 6′′x12′′ tile in the History Center’s iconic Great Hall. Made of aluminum or stainless steel, each engraved tile will join the ranks of history. Visitors who purchase tiles are also invited to write a 250-word tribute on the History Center’s website.

If you have a commemorative tile already and would like to find its location, please use our commemorative tile database for your search.

Cost: Tiles are available for contributions of $500 (steel) or $1,000 (aluminum).
