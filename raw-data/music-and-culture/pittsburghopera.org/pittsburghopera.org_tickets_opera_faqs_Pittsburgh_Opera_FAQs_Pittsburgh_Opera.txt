You can find the running time for each opera we present on its main website page, under "Details and Resources."

Typically first-timers like to start with classics like Madama Butterfly  (coming March, 2024) at the Benedum Center. They've got famous and familiar music, fantastic casts, traditional sets and costumes, and, well, that grand-opera grandness that so many people love.

You'll understand every word with the English texts projected above the stage.

Of course! Opera is fun for the whole family. We have kids who come to our student matinees and then make their parents come back so they can see the show again. The main thing is that your child should be able to sit quietly for long periods of time. Third or fourth graders are usually fine, but parents are the best judge. Pittsburgh Opera sells tickets for kids and teens ages 6-18 for half-price, to make it easier for you to expose them to this wonderful art form.

Some operas – OK, most operas – have adult themes. Murder, revenge, lust – all that stuff that grown-ups find so interesting. Kids do best if you prepare them in advance. Tell them the story of the opera, play some of the music, or watch a few videos on YouTube. Have your little Warhols and Cassatts draw pictures of their favorite characters or imagine what the set might be like. Be creative!

A little common courtesy is all you need. It probably bothers you when people talk and rattle their candy wrappers at the movies, or talk on their phones, or show up late, or get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the show. If something is considered poor form at the movies, it's probably poor form at the opera too.

If you’re not sure when to clap, just wait until everybody else does. If you really like what you hear, yell, “Bravo!” Or just cheer!

Yes! Our mainstage productions are at the Benedum Center. Our 2023-24 season features The Barber of Seville, The Flying Dutchman, and La Traviata at the Benedum Center live and large on the grand stage.

We’ve got lots of ways to get you tuned in. Try the free Pre-Opera Talks with Kristin Gatch one hour before every curtain at Benedum Center and CAPA Theater performances. You'll hear the story of the opera, some background about the composer, and maybe some behind-the-scenes stories.

Meet the Artists is after each Tuesday performance. Enjoy great coversation as the singers, conductor and General Director Christopher Hahn talk about the production and their experiences. You may be surprised to see how funny and down-to-earth these artists really are.
