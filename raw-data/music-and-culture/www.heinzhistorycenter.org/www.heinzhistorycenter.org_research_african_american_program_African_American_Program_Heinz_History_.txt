The African American Program at the Heinz History Center is dedicated to the preservation, dissemination, and interpretation of the life, history, and culture of Africans and African Americans in Western Pennsylvania.

This work is accomplished through research, artifact and archival collecting, consulting, educational programming, exhibitions, and public outreach. The emphasis of the African American Collection is to collect historically and culturally significant materials written, owned, generated by, created, used and/or related to African American people, living or deceased.

In addition to the institutional operations, the African American Program has a council of dedicated community volunteers that assist with programming and serves as the History Center’s liaison to the African American community of Western Pennsylvania.

The African American Advisory Council is a volunteer group of scholars, educators, artists, executives, entrepreneurs, journalists, politicians, and retirees. The council works with History Center staff as a liaison to the African American community and supports programming, promotes collection development, and assists in the facilitation of various projects.

Learn more about donating materials to the African American Collection by contacting contact Samuel W Black, director of African American Programs, at 412-454-6391 or [email protected].
