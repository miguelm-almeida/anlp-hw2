Great city... great neighbors! Young professionals, empty nesters, families—thousands are making their new home in Greater Downtown Pittsburgh. Downtown living. What’s the attraction? For many, the incredible convenience of walking to work is a perfect reason to start. But that’s only the beginning. The views are spectacular; the green spaces, including riverfront trails, are plentiful; theater, nightlife, great restaurants, and exciting sporting events are all within easy walking distance. And the living spaces themselves – from modern apartments and condos to spacious lofts in historic buildings – are beautifully distinctive. When you make the choice to live in Downtown Pittsburgh, you’ll be living in the best Downtown in America. Parks + Riverfront Downtown may be the City’s urban center, but we also have some great parks and riverfront trails to explore! Point State Park opened in 1974 and is a 36-acre park located at the tip of the Golden Triangle that features expansive lawns, riverfront tails, and the famous Point State Park Fountain which sprays water up to 150 feet into the air at the head of the park, where the Allegheny River and Monongahela River meet to form the Ohio River. Be sure to visit Golden Triangle Bike Rental or Kayak Pittsburgh to make the most of Point State Park and be sure to check out Friend’s of the Riverfront for information on riverfront trails and activities throughout Pittsburgh. Mellon Square, first opened in 1955, is a garden plaza, the first of its kind to be built atop a parking garage, that covers just over 1.25 acres. In 2014, the park was rededicated after a complete revitalization project was undertaken by the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy in cooperation with the City of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation. Market Square, the home of many of PDP’s programs such as the Market Square Farmers Market, is officially a City of Pittsburgh park! Be sure to keep an eye on our website for all of the latest events planned for the Square.

“We moved to the city because we wanted to be in the epicenter of Pittsburgh. Living downtown has allowed us to be spoiled by the convenience factor and amount of activities in downtown. We walk every day, take buses when necessary to Pitt or CMU, and have a car for emergencies. We would tell anyone considering moving downtown to – ‘Just do it!’” – Joe & Rosemarie “We choose to move downtown because we love architecture and we were looking for a cool urban space in which to live. We found our building walking from the YMCA one day. We live at 429 First Avenue which is a former paper warehouse that was converted into lofts in 1998. We were immediately drawn to the open industrial feel, the exposed ceiling beams and concrete floor. Since moving here almost 4 years ago, we can’t envision living anywhere else. Our favorite thing about living downtown is that we are within easy walking distance to the Strip District, North Shore, South Side, and Station Square – in addition to all of our favorite downtown locations. Although we still have the benefits of a small roof top garden, we no longer spend our weekends on yard work and driving for basic amenities. We are better able to take advantage of the recreational and cultural offerings that make Pittsburgh a great place to live.” – Chris and April “My husband and I moved from Boston to Pittsburgh in 2000 to launch AlphaGraphics in the Cultural District. Wanting to be close to our business, we were drawn to The Pennsylvanian for downtown living and the opportunity to be a part of the growing vitality of the arts and restaurant scene that was about to explode in the area. At The Pennsylvanian, we have a very unique, historic space to call home—it features dramatic 18-foot ceilings, stunning crown moldings, and gleaming hardwood floors and mahogany paneling. What’s the best part? We’re just steps away from hearing a world-class symphony concert, watching a Broadway show, dining at any number of wonderful restaurants, cheering on a professional sports team, and biking breathtaking trails along the three rivers. Having lived in other major metropolitan areas in urban settings, we think Pittsburgh is a real jewel—and so do our friends who come to visit us. One of my greatest pleasures is working out with my trainer near the stadiums along the water, with the backdrop of our beautiful city. We love living downtown and couldn’t imagine being in the suburbs.” – Clare “Downtown Pittsburgh is right now in the midst of the most impressive renaissance I have ever witnessed. It is so exciting and I am so hopeful about this City’s future that I am in the process of trying to open a hardware store down here. I see nothing but good coming our way and am delighted to live right here in the heart of it all and be a part of the new retail, art, and community scene I see unfolding. I attribute much of Pittsburgh’s rebirth to the hard work of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership and the conscious decision of our mayor to make Downtown Pittsburgh a safe and clean place for people to live, work and play 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. I am truly proud to be a Downtowner and invite others to come down here and give it a try!” – Donna Share this page Contact Us412-566-4190Email Us Pittsburgh Downtown PartnershipThe Bank Tower307 Fourth Avenue – Floor 2Pittsburgh, PA 15222 Share this page Connect With Us... © 2025 Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership.

Held in June, Market Square becomes a showcase for businesses, artists, makers, performers, food purveyors, and more from across the various international and newcomer communities. Developed in 2013, the Downtown Activation + Public Art initiative is a multi-year effort to enhance the Downtown neighborhood through public art events, creating thoughtful and innovative programming that enlivens unique areas throughout Downtown Pittsburgh. Live music plays an important role in providing a higher quality of life within urban neighborhoods by supporting cultural expression, social identity, economic development, and most importantly a positive and safe sense of place.

Developed in 2013, the Downtown Activation and Public Art initiative is a multi-year effort to enhance the Downtown neighborhood through public art events, creating thoughtful and innovative programming that enlivens unique areas throughout Downtown Pittsburgh. Our efforts employ object-, programming-, and community-based strategies to create a more sustainable neighborhood. Over the past few years, the PDP has successfully implemented a number of programs to enhance the vibrancy of Downtown, from the transformation of Market Square and the expansion of our programming to the installation of public art in Strawberry Way. To build upon these efforts, the PDP will continue to initiate a range of programs and installations that enliven Downtown. Penn Avenue | Around Downtown | Cultural District | Garrison Place | Strawberry Way | Market Square | Walking Tours & Publications Pittsburgh Postcard, 2022by Phil Seth Designed and painted by Pittsburgh native Phil Seth, this mural was created as part of efforts to enhance 6th Street as a destination dining corridor in the heart of Downtown’s Cultural District. This work is made possible with the generous support of the Benter Foundation. Emerging Visions 2.0, “Send My Love to the Hill,” 2024by Charlese Dawson Charlese Dawson’s “Send My Love to the Hill” is a love letter to the neighborhood where she grew up, connecting the past and present of both The Hill and her own experiences to imagine the future. Complemented by poet Jhordan Price near the corner of Seventh Ave and William Penn Place, Dawson’s work invites pedestrians and drivers to pause in their commutes and journeys to contemplate the life and joys of residents of the Hill District today. She brings in the voices of poets writing about Black life and joy, friendship, and family to complement her photographs that represent a community that has undergone dramatic change, decay, and renewal. Rainbow Road, 2022by Max Gonzales & Shane Pilsterand students from Pittsburgh CAPA This new 440-foot long street mural has transformed Downtown’s Strawberry Way into a vibrant work of public art created by students of Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts. Planting Seeds: Taking Steps, 2023by Do What We Love, a Pittsburgh-based artist duo created by Max Emiliano Gonzales and Shane Pilster The vibrant murals adorning the Frank & Seder Building at 441 Smithfield Street beautifully encapsulate nature’s tranquility and the bustling cityscape, adding a burst of color to a prominent corner of Downtown. They are part of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership’s Great Route Project, a transformative initiative aimed at enhancing the pedestrian experience in Downtown Pittsburgh. The Forbes Avenue side of the building features “Planting Seeds,” a mural that celebrates the natural beauty of Pittsburgh. Its design harmonizes with the new planters installed along the Forbes Avenue corridor, turning this high traffic area into a softer streetscape with more natural textures. In contrast, “Taking Steps,” located on the bustling Fifth Avenue side, captures the essence of an active Downtown streetscape. Greedy Pigeons, 2022by Josie Norton Coffey Way Shadow Gallery, 2024by Clear Story The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (PDP) has unveiled a new site-specific artistic lighting installation on Coffey Way between Sixth Avenue and Strawberry Way. With support from the PDP’s Uncommon & Curated Fund and a grant provided by the Colcom Foundation, the Shadow Gallery was created by Pittsburgh-based lighting design and production firm Clear Story, and is now operational in the evening hours. “The installation creates an experiential conversation between the patterns of light projection across the surfaces of Coffey Way and the images contained within the lightboxes,” said Rob Long, Principal and Design Director of Clear Story, a Pittsburgh-based design and consulting firm. Cultural Trust Projects Explore 13 different public art projects installed throughout the Cultural District in Downtown, including large-scale sculptural pieces, temporary activations, and art you can interact with. Elemental, 2024Carolina Loyola-Garcia Coming August 2024 Elemental is a site-specific multi-channel video installation designed to showcase a loop of nature videos depicting the ocean, an active erupting volcano, snow, wind, sunsets, clouds, and flora. The alternating footage of nature provides passersby a moment to wonder and a window into worlds far from the downtown business atmosphere. It is meant to serve as a moment of respite or as an invitation to a few minutes of meditation or solace. Read artist statement. Emerging Visions, 2023Various artists This collaboration with Silver Eye Center for Photography features the works of rising Pittsburgh artists on the windows of currently vacant storefronts along Liberty Ave., creating a public art gallery in the heart of Downtown. Skinny Building Mural, 2023by Alexis Gideon, Loring Taoka, and Sophia Marie Pappas The Art Supply Co. worked with PNC Bank to reimagine the historical Skinny Building in Downtown Pittsburgh with support from the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. The result is the Art in the Heart program, a large-scale mural project which covers the second and third story windows of one of the world’s narrowest commercial buildings. With theater lights placed strategically inside, the piece becomes a lightbox at night and encourages viewing at all hours. Through an open call for regional artists, three artists were chosen to participate in a paid design process: Alexis Gideon, Loring Taoka, and Sophia Marie Pappas. Judah, 2022 by Curtis Reeves Downtown Renown, 2020by Gavin Benjamin The “Downtown Renown” installation features 14 artworks and stories that celebrate the careers of Pittsburgh sports icons and athletic groundbreakers. Installed in windows around Downtown, find artistic renderings of household names from Mario Lemieux and Franco Harris, to Swin Cash, Dan McCoy, and more, showcasing a breadth of talent and accomplishments that is truly inspirational. Garrison Canal, 2018by Andrea Polli If you were disappointed to see the beautiful lighted artwork, Energy Flow, disappear from the Rachel Carson Bridge, you will be happy to learn that lighted elements of the original artwork have been re-used to create a dynamic new piece: Garrison Canal. Andrea Polli, who created the original work, has created the new light work which turns the Garrison Place alleyway into an imaginary underwater future world of big data. Visitors to the Canal “swim” below a wave of thousands of shimmering lights that transform color and animate in response to real-time changes in the local weather conditions from a weather station Downtown. The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership commissioned this piece as a wonderful opportunity to reuse elements of work that was much-loved by Pittsburghers and visitors alike. The project is part of a larger initiative to enliven Downtown alleyways with lighting, artwork, and pedestrian enhancements. Garrison Canal can be viewed in Garrison Place, between the 900 block of Liberty Avenue and Exchange Way. “Garrison Canal continues the effort of many in Downtown to utilize art to encourage exploration of our beautiful built environment” said Jeremy Waldrup, President and CEO of the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership. “Enhancing unexpected places through art makes a neighborhood unique, enjoyable and accessible for everyone.” Paint The Town Purple, 2024by Babesburgh Babesburgh is proud to launch Paint the Town Purple, a new public art exhibition funded by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership’s Placemaking Grant. Paint the Town Purple offers passersby a chance to see a visual, historical representation of 16 important women in Pittsburgh as imagined and illustrated by four Pittsburgh-based female artists. These incredible, colorful illustrations will be on display along Smithfield Street, at Mellon Square Park. “I’m immensely grateful for the opportunity to uplift and depict so many influential Pittsburgh women who made such an impact,” said Emily Paige Armstrong, one of the artists involved in the project, along with Janel Young, Stella Begnal, and Ifeoma Igwe. Thanks to our friends at the Office of Public Art and Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council, you can download free self-guided walking tours and a variety of publications detailing even more public art on display in and around Downtown.

Partners. Volunteers. Leaders. Alumni. Friends. The members of the CMU Alumni Association Board are all of these and more. This hardworking group of alumni reflects the diversity of the university’s alumni body, spanning a broad range of colleges, class years, careers and hometowns as well as interests and experiences. But they all have one thing in common: a dedication and love for CMU. AAB members use their creativity and professional and volunteer experience to work closely with the Office of Alumni & Constituent Engagement to develop and strengthen programs that connect alumni to CMU and to each other. For more information about the AAB and how to get involved, contact Jess Tkach in Alumni & Constituent Engagement. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?The CMU community is incredibly passionate and caring. Every time I'm surrounded by my fellow alumni, I'm always struck by how accomplished and enthusiastic they are about the impact they're making on the world. I like to be around people who are making moves — they inspire me constantly. Why did you join the AAB? I can humbly say that CMU made me the person I am today and I'm incredibly grateful to the staff, faculty, and my fellow students. This is my way of not only giving back to a school I love so much, but also a way for me to stay connected. Favorite CMU memory:My most cherished memories are when I was together with my amazing community, whether it be studying together in the ChemE cluster, practicing a piece for Dancers' Symposium, putting together the roof of SigEp's booth, or sneaking around campus rooftops (oops!). What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Honestly, the stories from fellow alumni make everything worth it. Each CMU alumni has such an amazing story, whether it's a story of their upbringing, the story of how they got to CMU, their CMU experience, or the story of whatever amazing thing they're inevitably up to. Favorite CMU memory:Joining Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, being a founding member of COMPASS, SPIRIT fashion show weekends, spending time with my residents when I was a Resident Assistant and hanging out in the CMARC office. Why did you join the AAB? I joined the AAB because CMU has left such an invaluable mark on my life. I believe in the vision of CMU and feel it is important to support CMU so that this phenomenal experience can be available for future generations. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Getting to meet new people who share my enthusiasm for the school and for creating the best experience for current and future students. Why did you join the AAB?Carnegie Mellon has always held such a special place in my heart and it's given me so much — and now it is time to give back. Favorite CMU memory:My final year at CMU, the university hosted the Frontiers Conference, which featured world-class innovators working at the cutting edge of personal, local, national, global, and interplanetary frontiers. I was invited because of my humble work starting an organization at the local frontier in Pittsburgh, and it was incredible getting a chance to hear President Obama speak about how new frontiers in science and technology will help improve lives and shape the future. It remains to be the coolest conference I've ever attended! Why did you join the AAB?I joined because I have loved being an active alumnus and serving as an organizer of DC's Globally Plaid series, speaking on alumni panels, serving as a Heinz College mentor, and helping with mock interviewing. The student group I founded in 2015, Students Using Data Science for Social Good, (which still exists!) was aimed at bringing together students from all of the colleges that CMU has and uniting them around a common purpose; I look forward to bringing that same sense of community to this role. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?The number of sheer jaw-dropping talented and distinguished alumni that have excelled in their verticals Why did you join the AAB?To stay engaged and give back to the University gave me life long friendships, mentors, memories and got me my job, giving me the foundation to set me up for life. Favorite CMU memory:As I walked through campus on graduation day I felt like every step on the sidewalk revealed a flashback to a moment. I felt all my effort, time, friendships and achievements of four years as we walked to the stadium. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I enjoy sharing the lessons that have stuck with me from my time at CMU with students. It's equally empowering and energizing to connect with fellow alumni, sharing our accomplishments and exchanging on ways to elevate the University and each other. Favorite CMU memory:The night the Steelers won Super Bowl XL. As news editor of The Tartan, I watched the game from the office as we put the newspaper to bed. A few of us left to celebrate, then came back to finish The Tartan in the middle of the night. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I love Carnegie Mellon. I am grateful for the opportunity to be involved at this level, to interface with faculty and staff, and to represent the diverse voices of our alumni. Through the AAB, I feel I’m able to offer a positive impact on the alumni community. Favorite CMU memory:The friends I made at the schools are still close friends. Why did you join the AAB?I'm proud of how the schools is growing and evolving and I wish to help shape the next evolution Favorite CMU memory:I was a member of an amazing team that won the University's first-ever Presidents Athletics Conference Championship in women's basketball and advanced to the NCAA regionals in 1989. Why did you join the AAB?I am looking forward to sharing my experiences and expertise for the benefit of a university that has done so much for me. Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory is walking back from an evening Chem lab class across campus and hearing someone practicing the bag pipes - quintessential CMU and a personal favorite since I was also a music minor. Why did you join the AAB?Interacting with CMU Alumni always makes me feel energized and excited and has helped me in a lot of transitions in my life. I wanted to help give that feeling back to alumni and give back to the school by joining the AAB. Favorite CMU memory:My favorite memory at CMU was to be a part of two acts in Tepper follies my graduating year. I was part of an international fashion show and also did a ballroom dance group number. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I enjoy most going to campus events and learning about the latest cutting edge research by students and professors. A bonus is actually talking to the students on their research studies. Favorite CMU memory:I bleed Carnegie Plaid. If you really want my attention, include Scotty Dog. My first month of school, I had tailgate parties that included such dignitaries as university Deans and the famed mascot himself. This memory is one of my favorites and most mentioned by my good friends from CMU. Why did you join the AAB?My passion for CMU has not waned since leaving Pittsburgh. As an alumnus, I have been active with Carnegie Mellon University and Heinz College and participate in many alumni events and programs - both social and academic. This includes recruiting, student consulting initiatives, and attending alumni events near home. I recently moved from Chicago to Colorado. What do you like most about staying engaged?One of the benefits of being on a college campus is the diversity of thought. This diversity challenges your belief system and makes you question your purpose as well as contributions to society. I found inspiration in our student body as this engagement only makes me a better person. Why did you join the AAB?Volunteering has afforded me the opportunity to give back. If we are stronger together, working with individuals who share the same passion for making Carnegie Mellon the best it can be, can only yield a positive outcome. I want to be the representative who encourages other alumni to get engaged. Favorite CMU memory:PhD Graduation Ceremony. August Wilson, who was awarded a honorary PhD, gave a very inspiring and thought provoking speech. Why did you join the AAB?Create a stronger alumni network that becomes an advantage and differentiator. Raise the profile of CMU in the US and internationally. Favorite CMU memory:I remember how excited I was the day I pledged my fraternity. I have such fond memories of all the major events on campus including Spring Carnival, Home Coming and intramural sports. Why did you join the AAB?I am so incredibly grateful for Carnegie Mellon for the terrific education and wonderful on-campus experience afforded me. I am indebted to the university for being so supportive in helping me pursue my post-graduate education and my career. I love coming back to campus and interfacing with the students, faculty and staff. This Board provides yet another opportunity for me to have a positive impact at the University level and in the alumni community. Favorite CMU memory:During my 10 years as a CMU undergrad, PhD student, and instructor from the 1960’s through the mid 1970’s, I took advantage of the unique environment where everyone on campus could use CMU computers, initially with punch cards and later in computer rooms with teletypes. I was a participant in the formation of a new discipline. I also loved playing clarinet in the Kiltie Marching and Concert bands with the fabulous music majors. We had memorable trips performing at a National Music Educators convention in Buffalo and at Town Hall in New York City. Why did you join the AAB?Being from SCS and being retired, I hope to bring a unique perspective to the Alumni Board. I want to learn more about CMU’s academic and research initiatives in Pittsburgh and other CMU campuses, and how the Alumni Board interacts with the multi-campus alumni. Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory is when I outsmarted those who were against SPIRIT's "Black Week," joined the Student Senate Finance Committee, and made "Black Week" an official arm of the Student Senate so it could be funded directly from student activities funds and not bake sales and car washes. Why did you join the AAB?I joined because I was chosen to be a part of this elite group in which I take great pride. It is an honor and a privilege and a once in a lifetime event for me that means I get to give back in my own unique way! Favorite CMU Memory:My experience at CMU is a trove of memories: Crew Club, meeting and dating my husband, hard and fun work in the 3D wood shop, and the Beaux Arts Ball. My peers and the staff made each moment special. One poignant memory was sledding by the cafeteria on trays! What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Tartan pride is alive in my household. The connection we have from studying at, working at, and/or supporting Carnegie Mellon University is genuine and rewarding. It brings me joy to build personal relationships with the CMU community and receive a smile simply from saying, I am a Tartan, too! Favorite CMU Memory:It is really hard to pick just one! A big highlight was planning the concert for the 100th Carnival; being on Activities Board was an amazing community, and getting to plan and see the events was so energizing. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I loved my time at CMU. I got so much out of it, and one of the best parts was the people. Joining AAB allows me to be involved in the CMU community, and help alumni connect back to CMU and to each other. Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory was the INI holiday party and the spirited karaoke-ing to "Hey Jude" with friends and faculty. Between such moments of levity and all of the hard work, I forged some lifelong friendships at CMU. Why did you join the AAB?CMU has been a big part of my life and career and I am very proud to be a Tartan. I want to be able to contribute back to the school and help bring the alumni community together. Favorite CMU memory:Going to the "Apple Orchards", not knowing Apple would grow to its size today but thinking how innovative and convenient it was back then. That convenience made it easy to be efficient with projects and homework, which enabled me to indulge in Buggy ... a sincere passion, GO SPIRIT!!! Why did you join the AAB?Having been an active alum for many years, my professional experience will hopefully be extremely helpful to both alums and the university. Specifically, giving-back in any fashion has been a passion for decades and having raised two daughters who are both college graduates, along with corporate experience in recruiting and career development, I believe I can help improve the experience for all parties involved. Favorite CMU memory:Watching my two older sisters apply to, study at, and graduate from CMU was probably one of the most impactful and inspiring CMU memories of mine. They blazed the trail, set the standards and showed me what was possible at, and with, a degree and network from CMU. What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?It is so exciting to be around such a motivated, intelligent and hard-working group of people, across disciplines. I love to hear about what different students and alumni are doing as well as learn from them. Each year, the AAB chooses new members who are eager to contribute to the university and the global CMU alumni community.

The CMU Alumni Association proudly honors these members of the CMU community, all of whom have made an impact on their industries, their communities, their alma mater and others' lives around the world. The annual Alumni Awards event brings alumni, students, faculty, staff and friends together to celebrate those receiving the Founders Medal for Outstanding Service and Exceptional Achievement, Alumni Achievement Awards, Alumni Service Awards and Recent Alumni Awards. The Founders Medal is presented to an alumnus/a in recognition of both a longstanding record of service to and support for Carnegie Mellon University, and a record of professional or vocational achievements that are truly exceptional and have brought honor and prestige to themselves and to CMU. All alumni are eligible for this award, including those who have received prior alumni honors from the university or one of its colleges, schools or departments. Awarded to an alumnus/a for exceptional accomplishment and leadership in the nominee's professional or vocational field, which brings distinction to themselves and honor to the university. The contribution(s) need not be publicly renowned but should represent important creative effort or accomplishment with significant impact and value. Presented to an alumnus/a for volunteer service to the university or any of its alumni organizations. Several dimensions of service are considered, including breadth of service (service in multiple CMU volunteer roles), depth or longevity of service, and impact of volunteer service on the alumni organization and/or the university. Financial contributions are specifically excluded from consideration for this award, although volunteer service soliciting contributions on behalf of the university or service on CMU fundraising committees is applicable. This award does not consider volunteer service to non-CMU organizations. Similarly, Carnegie Mellon employees or those alumni with business relationships to the university are not eligible on the basis of their employment duties or business services. CMU's greatest assets are its people — the alumni, students, faculty, staff and friends who have forged CMU's legacy of innovation and excellence. Since 1950, the CMU Alumni Awards have recognized alumni in the CMU community for their service to the university and their impact on the world, and for their accomplishments and leadership in their professional or vocational fields. Help us honor outstanding Tartans with these four, easy-to-complete steps: We encourage nominators to review the Alumni Awards categories to ensure you’re selecting the best fit for your nominee.

Like last year, all 30 Major League clubs will field teams of their best prospects at the showcase CLEARWATER, Fla. – This year’s Trade Deadline will arrive on July 31, but the Braves won’t have to wait until the dog days of summer to make some impactful acquisitions.

PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. -- The Rays announced Thursday that they will not be moving forward with their plans to build a new ballpark as part of a redeveloped Historic Gas Plant District in St. Petersburg. The Rays made the news official on their social media accounts with a statement from CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Long after Zack Wheeler and Jesús Luzardo pitched a simulated game on Monday at BayCare Ballpark, Bryce Harper grabbed his first baseman’s mitt. A morning downpour had postponed his scheduled infield work, but he did not want to skip it.

Paul Skenes striking out Jackson Holliday. Jackson Chourio reaching twice and scoring a run. Jace Jung hitting a pair of homers. FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The Red Sox feel better about their starting pitching depth than they’ve felt in years, and it’s going to be put to the test early in the season. Red Sox manager Alex Cora revealed to The Boston Globe before Thursday’s game in Port St. Lucie against Cubs outfielder Seiya Suzuki stepped into the batting cage recently to take some cuts. Literally. Ahead of next week’s Tokyo Series, the native of Japan stepped into the right-handed batter’s box wielding not a baseball bat but a SAMURAI SWORD -- and what came next was exactly what you’d expect PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- In a vacuum, Jeff McNeil’s injury is “a minor hiccup,” as the second baseman put it -- an unfortunate case of a right oblique strain with two weeks to go until Opening Day.

While Guerrero doesn’t seem distracted in the least, this remains a story that is going to hang over the Blue Jays TOKYO -- When Luis Cruz first saw Shohei Ohtani -- then a 19-year-old in his second professional season in Japan -- the former remembers thinking, "Oh my God, this guy's going to be good." That said, Cruz had no idea at the time that Ohtani -- whom he thought would It has never been done in Major League Baseball. It may well never be done in Major League Baseball.

Greg Brown is is in his 31st year as a radio and television play-by-play announcer with the Pirates. Greg’s association with the Pirates began in 1979, when he interned in the promotions department while attending Point Park University. Following the World Series that year, Brown worked as the clubhouse manager at Pirate City during the Instructional League program in Bradenton, Florida. His 10-year stint in the Bucs front office included work in the Marketing, Public Relations and Broadcasting departments. Greg also served as the team’s public address announcer during the 1987 campaign. In 1988, he was a sports anchor on WFMJ-TV in Youngstown, OH. Prior to joining Pittsburgh’s broadcast team in 1994, Brown spent five seasons (1989-1993) doing play-by-play and color commentary for the Buffalo Bisons of the American Association (now International League) as well as hosting a sportstalk show on WGR Radio. He also worked as a color analyst and a pre and postgame show host for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League for five seasons (1989-93). Brown’s dedication and passion for the Pirates extends to his efforts away from the broadcast booth as he makes numerous off-season appearances in the community, both in the Pittsburgh area and in Bradenton during spring training. Brown is a native of Washington, D.C. He currently resides in Renfrew, PA, with his wife, Kim, and their son. Joe Block is in his ninth season of calling Pirates play-by-play action, having joined the TV and radio broadcast teams in 2016.

After an emotional farewell game in Pittsburgh back in October, Marc-Andre Fleury played against the Penguins for the final time on Sunday in Minnesota. In that first matchup, the beloved, fan-favorite netminder - who was drafted by Pittsburgh first overall in 2003 and won three Stanley Cups during his 14 years with the franchise - made 29 saves in a 5-3 Wild victory. Today, however, his oldest friends secured final bragging rights - with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin both scoring in a 3-1 win. âI was waiting for Tanger (Kris Letang) to score!â Bryan Rust joked afterward. âBut yeah, itâs cool. Sid and I were actually joking about it before the game. I was like, wouldnât that be nice if you got the game-winner tonight? And here we are [laughs].â Meanwhile, Fleuryâs line of thinking had been, there's no way these guys will score on me! "Oh my God. Anyone but these two,â Fleury said afterward. âI feel like I'm going to hear about this for a long time. Sid is still talking about his goal in junior against me.â As he was making those remarks in the home dressing room, Crosby confirmed them from the visitors dressing room. âTo get one there in the last game against him, I will remind him of that many times,â the captain said with a grin. Crosby speaks to the media As always, Crosby and Malkin found a way to craft a great script. It felt so fitting that those two were the only players to find the back of the net against one of their all-time favorite teammates, considering how much they loved competing against each other in practices. âHe's probably saved a lot more than I've scored against him, but definitely a fun competition there,â Crosby said. âHaving to go against him every day in practice, enjoyed that. That definitely made me better, and having him as a teammate did, too.â Fleury called that his favorite part of their time together. âObviously, playing together, winning together, those are such good memories and a lot of fun and all the best,â Fleury said. âBut to be with these guys every day, and the group of guys that we had all these years is awesome, you know? So, to battle with them and have some laughs in practice and yell at them when I stop them... though tonight, I couldnât laugh at them.â Crosby admitted that his goal was lucky, as it went off Wild defenseman Brock Faber before crossing the goal line. Malkinâs came on the power play before Crosby iced the win with an empty-netter. After the game, they caught up with Fleury in the hallway outside of the locker room. âSometimes, you make good friends, you see guys every day for 14 years with these guys, and I don't see them much anymore, right?â Fleury said. âSo, it's hard. It's hard when that happens, right? But I still always keep such good memories, and when we see each other, it feels like no timeâs passed, right? It's like, back to our time there together.â Fleury speaks to the media While Crosby said the most important thing was to compete and have fun with this day, he did do some reflecting coming into the contest. For him, what came to mind is how fast time goes. âYou feel like yesterday, you're coming into the league,â Crosby said. âI was so happy to be joining a young group of guys, including Flower, that had high expectations. We were all kind of growing up together in the league. So, I think you reflect on that. Just all the great moments that he was a part of, and just all the little things, not even hockey sometimes. Whether it's the road trips or the off-ice, that stuff, thatâs the kind of stuff that sticks with you.â Another fitting part of today was Fleury moving into second place for all-time starts among goaltenders in NHL history (1,015), against the team he spent more than half of them with. âTo play as long as he has at such a high level, you have to truly love what you do, and he does,â Penguins head coach Mike Sullivan said. âYou can see it every day with how he goes about his business, how he carries himself. He loves being on the ice. He loves competing with his teammates, and I think that's why he's beloved, because of his joy and love for the game, and the position that he plays. Thatâs why he's been able to endure. âI mean, he's a talented guy and all of that, and a fierce competitor, but there's a lot of talented guys. His passion for the game, I think, is what has allowed him to endure the career that he has for as long as he has.â The plan is for Fleury to play the rest of this season, and then officially hang them up. With the Wild in the playoff mix and looking to make a run, Fleury couldnât let himself get too caught up in the significance of this game. At least, not right now. âHonestly, I tried to not make it too emotional... I just tried to stay in the moment, play the game,â Fleury said. âI think it's something I will think about and look back in the years to come.â Founding Partners pittsburghpenguins.com is the official website of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Heâs posted a 2-0-0 record with a 1.49 goals-against average and a .955 save percentage, both of which rank first among all goaltenders since March 9. Penguins Captain Sidney Crosby had four-straight goals for the Penguins, scoring the last two goals at Minnesota on Sunday and the first two goals vs. Vegas on Tuesday. The forward leads the Penguins in assists (47) and points (70). With multiple goals tonight, Crosby will record just the second three-game multi-goal streak of his career. His only three-game multi-goal streak came from November 28-December 3, 2009 (7G). Crosby has recorded a multi-goal game against 31 different franchises, which is the most among all players in NHL history. The only teams he has yet to accomplish the feat against are Utah and Pittsburgh. With three more assists, Crosby will have the 12th 50-assist season of his career, tying Adam Oates for the eighth-most such seasons in NHL history. He is currently three points away from tying Wayne Gretzky for the fourth-most points with a single franchise in NHL history. Crosby has been on an exceptional run at PPG Paints Arena as the forward has had points in eight-straight home games dating back to Feb. 1.

After Tuesdayâs overtime win against Vegas, Tristan Jarry handed the player of the game helmet to Erik Karlsson, who had scored the winner. âI would give it to you back if I could,â the defenseman told his goaltender. As Mike Sullivan put it, Jarry was the difference in that game â just like he was on Sunday in Minnesota, his first NHL game action since Jan. 14 against Seattle. Prior to that, Jarry had been with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League after being placed on waivers, as he struggled to find consistency during the first three-plus months of the year. âIt was a tough time for me. It was something that I had to work through, and I think it was something that I needed to look at myself in the mirror and say I have to have a better game,â Jarry said. âJust going down, working hard and working on my game was a big help for me. Obviously, I had a lot of support, so I think that helped a lot. Coming back here, I wanted to put my best foot forward and show the Penguins that I could do it.â Jarry speaks to the media. They knew Jarry was capable, as heâs put together a solid body of work in this league thatâs included two NHL All-Star nods and some good runs â but also understood the challenge of trying to come out on the other side stronger. It couldâve been easy to fold under the weight of everything. Instead, Jarry handled it tremendously well. âItâs not an easy situation, whether itâs losing or being in the position he was in. As a goalie, there is so much pressure and so much expectations,â Sidney Crosby said. âI think being put in that situation, going to Wilkes, coming back, responding the way he has says a lot about him and his work ethic and his willingness to keep working and battle through it. Heâs done a great job of it, and weâre all definitely happy for him.â Going into that first matchup with the Wild, Jarry admitted to feeling some nerves along with excitement, saying he tried using it to his advantage. He ended up stopping 29 of 30 shots in a 3-1 win, and was particularly strong on a successful four-minute penalty kill. When asked about Jarryâs performance following the game, Bryan Rust broke into a huge grin. âI love that sh*t,â the star winger said. âHe was awesome tonight. He's been through a lot, obviously. He's come right back up here, great attitude, came in and had a hell of a game. I think that shows how high character he is.â Jarry followed that up with another strong outing once the team returned home following a three-game trip that included the trade deadline. Sullivan used the word âspectacularâ to describe Jarryâs play. âHe just looks big in the net,â Sullivan went on to say. âThe vantage point I get from the bench, you just don't see a whole lot, and thatâs usually a sign that he's playing a confident game. He's tracking pucks. He's playing with confidence. He's got a calm demeanor. His handles, as far as when he comes out and plays a puck, have been simple and efficient.â In addition to what Jarryâs brought on the ice, heâs been the exact same person off of it. Jarry came back to Pittsburgh with a great attitude, humble and candid about his game, but the same terrific teammate. Heâs quietly one of the funniest guys in the room with his quick wit and dry humor, someone everyone enjoys being around, and theyâre glad to have Jarry back. âComing in, he hasn't changed one bit, which is awesome to see,â Karlsson said. âIt's easy to get down on yourself, but I think that he's come in here, and he believes in himself, and he's the same person he was since last we saw him. The last few games for us here, obviously he's proven that he's capable of winning games for us.â Founding Partners pittsburghpenguins.com is the official website of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Over the last year, Penguins President of Hockey Operations and GM Kyle Dubas and his staff have accrued assets, flexibility and cap space as they work to return the Penguins to contention as soon as possible. This week alone, which culminated with the NHL trade deadline on Friday, Pittsburgh collected a number of draft picks after the moves they made â which were: At this point, no team has more draft picks or selections in the first three rounds over the next three NHL Drafts than Pittsburgh. âTriples of the third (round) of (2025), triples of the second (round) in (2026) and triples again of the third (round) of (2027). Triples is best,â Dubas said with a smile. Now, the Penguins will start executing on the haul theyâve collected, guided by this main question: whatâs in the best interest of the team? For example, it wonât be feasible for the Penguins to use every single draft pick and expect all of those players to become part of the club sooner rather than later. Instead, theyâll make picks available for trade. âIf there are opportunities to use the excess capital that weâve accumulated, whether itâs cap space or draft picks or to add players to the program to help propel it ahead, we wonât hesitate to do that,â said Dubas, who understands that being sellers at the trade deadline is not what fans are used to in Pittsburgh, and said this canât be the norm every year. âI think Iâve always come in and said there is no ambition on my end to have this take any longer than it needs to take, both for the city and for the people who have put in a lot. Thatâs not just players, but staff that has been around for a long time. There is a certain level, and when the level drops off, you donât want the standards and the core ideology to erode. Thatâs what we worked towards each day.â The goal, said Dubas, is to try and build a group around the core players â starting with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang, with Erik Karlsson, Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell included in that mix â and give them one or two more chances to win while theyâre still on their current contracts, which have varying timelines. That being said, Dubas made a point to emphasize that they wonât necessarily turn around and spend all of their assets this summer, saying that some patience is still required, and that expectations must be tempered. âWe're going to survey the landscape as urgently as we can each day to find moves that can best help propel the team ahead,â Dubas said. âIf there aren't moves available, we will execute on these picks with our personnel staff â with (director of professional personnel) Andy Saucier and (vice president of player personnel) Wes Clark â to make sure we're bringing the best young talent that we can. âHow it lines up with the older players, all I can give is my pledge that we are going through everything we can to attempt to have them all have one last chance, or multiple, depending on how long they play. I'm not going to start to doubt with these guys.â In the meantime, Dubas said the message to Pittsburghâs roster moving forward through the rest of the season is that they expect the standards to be upheld, and they expect the players to come in, play hard and be at their best every single day. âThereâs a massive amount of opportunities for these guys who are on short-term deals or that have aspirations to remain in the league,â Dubas said. âFor the guys who have been up and down in the minors or here, for the new players coming in (like) Connor Dewar and Conor Timmins, Tommy Novak â itâs a great opportunity to assert themselves for where they want to be next season. Theyâre all under team control. We have huge expectations in Wilkes-Barre for what theyâre going to do the rest of the year, as well. âI know itâs not typical and we wonât allow it to become typical, but I do think this remaining five or six weeks is a great opportunity for the organization and the players within to show us that they are a part of bringing us back into contention.â Dubas also went into specifics on a few players, starting with the ones whose names came up the most in trade rumors. Hereâs what he had to say about those guys... RICKARD RAKELL: âHe is a big part of our program. â¦ Everyone has seen this year - heâs got a long history of the type of player that he is â but we see him every day, the type of person he his as well. When you have players that perform that way on a game-in, game-out basis that show the ability to respond when things donât go well then can propel themselves back into being near the top of the league and perform at that level, itâs not something that you â especially when you have them signed and they want to be a part of the community, they want to be part of the program, they know the path that weâre on and they want to be a part of helping to bring the team back to being in contention â I would say that you donât just push that out the door because that may be whatâs wanted. You have to do whatâs right for the Pittsburgh Penguins. And for us, having Rickard Rakell as part of the Pittsburgh Penguins was definitely the right thing to do as we measured it up against everything. Weâre happy to have him, heâs a big part of what we do and I know he really wants to be here.â MATT GRZELCYK: âThere was interest, teams kicking tires, but in the end, we got through the deadline and he remains a member of our team. We expect him to continue to have a strong season and when we brought him in, I pledged that we would give him the opportunity to get things back rolling. He's taken advantage of that. We'll continue to push him to do so here through the last stretch of the year." ERIK KARLSSON: âHe came in the same summer I did. The team is coming out of missing the playoffs. The attempt was to bring him in and the things we did in the summer of '23 to try to get a run, that was the strategy. Try to give it one jolt to try to propel it back in. It didn't work. So, Erik, to me, it's really from a team perspective, not having to do with Erik. The team is not in the contending space that it was in for the decades prior, frankly. So, with him, he's such a talented player. I know, night in and night out, like our team has, it can be a little up and down. But the skating continues to be some of the best in the league. Obviously, offensively and puck movement continues to be at that level. We have to keep pushing him. I think he can be a part of helping our team continue to move along. So, I don't sense with his skating or his talent and ability that there's going to be any real dropoff. There was no discussion, there was nothing taken to him about waiving his no-move. And he's not a player that we would look to just move along. He's a hugely valuable player in the league.

By Ali Trachta This year, maybe more than ever, we can all agree that voting is important. First and foremost, in this upcoming November election (stay tuned for our comprehensive Election Guide with details on candidates up and down the ballot). But second, just behind that, the most consequential vote you can make in this town, we think, is for Pittsburgh City Paper’s Best Of PGH Reader’ Poll winners. And boy oh boy, did yinz turn out. More than 25,000 of you, to be more precise, cast a staggering 321,269 votes up and down our ballot, creating a catalog of the abundant coolness permeating this city. Different people, places, and businesses, all nominated by you, duked it out for the top spot in categories like Best Nail Artist, Best Black-Owned Hair Salon, Best Happy Hour, Best Pierogies, and Best Bike Trail, as well as in curveballs like Best Bar to Drink Alone, Best Place to Celebrate Your Divorce, and Best Place to Have Sex in Public (do not tell them we sent you). But we still wanted to have more fun, so this year, City Paper’s editorial team threw in a bunch of extra Staff Picks to help you find some hidden Pittsburgh gems like Best Place to Get a Weird Flash Tattoo, Best Shitty Beer, Best Neighborhood to Pretend You're on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, and Best Unexpected Place to Spot Hotties. So dive in, enjoy, and a big, big thank you for exercising those voting muscles. Next, fellow Western Pa.-ers, we’ll use them to save democracy. -Ali Trachta Editor-in-Chief The best vegan and vegetarian eats in Pittsburgh for the plant-based and the plant-curious By Aakanksha Agarwal Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Pittsburgh’s top events: March 13-19 By CP Staff Tags © 2025 Pittsburgh City Paper

We the People of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh is known as many things: a union town, a tech darling, an “eds and meds” mecca, a haven for pierogi obsessives. But maybe Pittsburgh’s real treasure is, as they say, the friends we make along the way. It’s the people — our neighbors — who embody the true spirit of this place. The ones who want our hometown to be the best it can be, and who do the work to make that happen. This year’s class inducts movers and shakers from all corners of our community, such as Herman "Soy Sos" Pearl and Staycee Pearl, partners in life and work who are magnifying Black art from their studio in Braddock, and Nik Forsberg of Fet-Fisk, whose pop-up turned brick-and-mortar restaurant is receiving well-deserved national attention. We’re also honoring nurses who are carving a path for other healthcare workers, young activists risking their futures, and many others. We hope you read about this year’s award winners and feel proud that these are the sort of hardworking, problem-solving people Pittsburgh produces. Cheers to the honorees, who are rightfully the toast of the town. -Ali Trachta Editor-in-Chief People of the Year 2024 By Ali Trachta Pittsburgh's People of the Year 2024 — Visual Art: Emmai Alaquiva By Amanda Waltz Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Business: Khamil Bailey By Maia Williams Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Politics: Barb Warwick By Rachel Wilkinson Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Labor: West Penn Nurses By Colin Williams Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Music: Vicious Blade By Colin Williams Pittsburgh's People of the Year 2024 — Food and Drink: Nik Forsberg of Fet-Fisk By Rachel Wilkinson Pittsburgh's People of the Year 2024 — Activism: Students for Justice in Palestine By Rachel Wilkinson Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Literature: Michael Wurster By Jess Simms Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Health: Alecia Ott, Auto(nomous) Body Shop By India Krug Pittsburgh’s People of Year 2024 — Performing Arts: Herman "Soy Sos" Pearl and Staycee Pearl By Kahmeela Adams-Friedson Code & Crematory 2025 Wed., March 26, 7 p.m. @ LaRoche College Crafts & Crafts: Cat Toys @ Two Frays Brewery Love is in the air and on the calendar with these Valentine’s Day events By Rachel Wilkinson ‌This‌ ‌winter’s‌ ‌must-see‌ ‌arts‌ ‌and‌ ‌cultural‌ productions By CP Staff People of the Year 2024 By Ali Trachta Election 2024 By Colin Williams ‌The big, spooky Pittsburgh event guide: Oct. 3-Oct. 31 By CP Staff BEST OF PITTSBURGH 2024 Reader's Poll By Ali Trachta The furry helpers behind the scenes — City Paper's staff pets By CP Staff The big Pittsburgh summer events guide Make the most of your Pittsburgh summer with festivals, concerts, parties, and more By CP Staff Pittsburgh’s top events this spring: March 21-June 19 By CP Staff The best vegan and vegetarian eats in Pittsburgh for the plant-based and the plant-curious By Aakanksha Agarwal Women’s soccer will be metal on metal in Pittsburgh this year By Colton Coreschi It took more than luck to cultivate Pittsburgh's Irish traditions By Aakanksha Agarwal Pittsburgh’s top events: March 13-19 By CP Staff © 2025 Pittsburgh City Paper

By Ali Trachta This year, maybe more than ever, we can all agree that voting is important. First and foremost, in this upcoming November election (stay tuned for our comprehensive Election Guide with details on candidates up and down the ballot). But second, just behind that, the most consequential vote you can make in this town, we think, is for Pittsburgh City Paper’s Best Of PGH Reader’ Poll winners. And boy oh boy, did yinz turn out. More than 25,000 of you, to be more precise, cast a staggering 321,269 votes up and down our ballot, creating a catalog of the abundant coolness permeating this city. Different people, places, and businesses, all nominated by you, duked it out for the top spot in categories like Best Nail Artist, Best Black-Owned Hair Salon, Best Happy Hour, Best Pierogies, and Best Bike Trail, as well as in curveballs like Best Bar to Drink Alone, Best Place to Celebrate Your Divorce, and Best Place to Have Sex in Public (do not tell them we sent you). But we still wanted to have more fun, so this year, City Paper’s editorial team threw in a bunch of extra Staff Picks to help you find some hidden Pittsburgh gems like Best Place to Get a Weird Flash Tattoo, Best Shitty Beer, Best Neighborhood to Pretend You're on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, and Best Unexpected Place to Spot Hotties. So dive in, enjoy, and a big, big thank you for exercising those voting muscles. Next, fellow Western Pa.-ers, we’ll use them to save democracy. -Ali Trachta Editor-in-Chief Tags © 2025 Pittsburgh City Paper

Watt schreiben Steelers-Geschichte. Punkte, Punkte, Punkte: Die krassesten Steelers Games aller Zeiten! Was unseren Quarterback so besonders macht, erfÃ¤hrst du hier. Als Quarterback-JÃ¤ger hatte er in der Preseason 2024 richtig rasiert â bevor er von einer Verletzung ausgebremst wurde. Die Pro Bowl Games sind das All-Star-Wochenende im Football â und du kannst dafÃ1⁄4r sorgen, dass viele Steelers-Stars dabei sind. So schafft es die Steelers Nation immer wieder, AuswÃ¤rtsspiele zu Heimspielen zu machen Unter dem Quarterback blÃ1⁄4ht die Offensive der Steelers auf â das sind die GrÃ1⁄4nde dafÃ1⁄4r Mit seinem Sack gegen die Dallas Cowboys am 5.

Julius Welschofs Traum von der NFL lebt â bei den Pittsburgh Steelers kÃ¶nnte er jetzt ganz groÃ durchstarten. Die positiven VerÃ¤nderungen der Offensive durch Offensive Coordinator Arthur Smith sind deutlich spÃ1⁄4rbar â auch Defensive und Special Teams zeigen sich optimistisch. Die Pittsburgh Steelers haben eine Lizenz fÃ1⁄4r das Global Markets Program in Deutschland erhalten, wie die National Football League (NFL) heute bekannt gab Wie sich Santonio Holmes im Super Bowl XLIII verewigte â und Pittsburgh zum NFL-Rekordmeister machte. Steelers-Cheftrainer Mike Tomlin hat schon immer auf Geschwister in seinem Kader gesetzt. Hier erfÃ¤hrst du, warum Familie ihm so wichtig ist.

Watt ist das Gesicht der Franchise â und folgende Geschichten Ã1⁄4ber ihn solltest du kennen. Seit 2017 mischt JuJu Smith-Schuster im Dienste der Pittsburgh Steelers gegnerische Verteidigungen auf. Grund genug, ihn noch ein bisschen besser kennen (und lieben) zu lernen. Erfolg verpflichtet, Tradition noch viel mehr. Als eines der Ã¤ltesten Teams der NFL haben die Pittsburgh Steelers und ihre Fans Ã1⁄4ber die Jahre eine ganz besondere Kultur geprÃ¤gt. Big Ben und Troy Polamalu haben mit den Steelers zwei Super-Bowl-Titel gewonnen. Ernie Stautner ist der einzige in Deutschland geborene Hall of Famer.

The Pittsburgh Steelers will play their first ever regular season game at Croke Park in Dublin in 2025, as part of expanding their footprint into Ireland. The Steelers and Ireland have a deep-rooted connection. Read more >>> The Rooney family emigrated from the town of Newry in Northern Ireland to the United States in the 19th century, where the family ultimately settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Dan Rooney joined forces with Pittsburgh businessman Anthony J.F. O'Reilly to create The Ireland Fund in 1976, which merged with the American Irish Foundation to create the American Ireland Funds, a leading charitable organization benefiting Ireland. Dan Rooney's love of Ireland also fueled a passion to bring an NFL game to Ireland, a that dream became a reality when the Steelers took on the Chicago Bears in a preseason game in 1997 at Croke Park. Dan Rooney was asked to serve as United States Ambassador to Ireland by President Barack Obama, a role he cherished from 2009-2012. While in Ireland serving as Ambassador, Rooney visited all 32 counties on the island, meeting with politicians, media, business leaders and citizens. The Pittsburgh Steelers were awarded rights to expand their brand and activities for the Republic of Ireland & Northern Ireland, as part of the NFL's 'Global Markets Program', on May 23, 2023.

Michael McQuaid, Host of 'The Irish Steelers Podcast, Â reports the fan view on the island of Ireland after Friday's historic news. Historic game to be played in Dublin's iconic Croke Park Croke Park has hosted thousands of the country's most famous sporting events Starting in 2025, the NFL has the right to schedule up to 8 regular season international games per season. Up to 4 teams from the conference hosting a ninth regular season home game are now designated to play a neutral-site international game each year. In 2025, AFC teams will have a ninth home game on their schedule. Teams are selected based on the league's rotational system, which considers conference scheduling and teams that have Global Market Program rights in specific markets. The NFL has earmarked Dublin as a new international game market for 2025 and strategically selected the Steelers to play in the game as the designated team. As part of the Global Markets Program the Steelers have been awarded marketing rights on the island of Ireland because of Steelers' ownership family's deep roots there. Global growth is a major strategic priority for the league and 32 teams. Playing games outside the United States and expanding the league's global footprint is a key part of that strategy. The league's international games take American football to new fans and communities around the world. The Steelers will host 8 regular-season home games and 1 preseason home game at Acrisure Stadium in 2025. As this is a year in which AFC teams have a ninth regular season home game, the Dublin game will see the Steelers' designated to play the ninth game in Dublin in 2025. The Steelers and the NFL will host fan activities in Dublin leading up to the game. More information on these details will be released later this year. We encourage you to sign up for Steelers emails and to follow the Steelers social media platforms for information and updates on the events that the Steelers will host in Ireland.

The 'Global Markets Program', which launched in January 2022 as the International Home Marketing Areas (IHMA), grants NFL clubs access to international markets for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization activations as part of an important, long-term strategic effort to enable clubs to build their brands globally while driving NFL fan growth beyond the US. NFL clubs can apply for rights to selected international markets by submitting proposals for the International Committee to review each Spring. Clubs are awarded rights for at least a five-year term through the program. During this period, a club has the rights to pursue activities in that international market that are consistent with what they can do in their home market. There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997. Mrs. Patricia Rooney, whose family emigrated from County Mayo in the 1920s, was a guiding force in the establishment of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature. When the NFL created the opportunity for all teams to become active in international markets, Ireland was on the team's short list. This license will enable the Steelers to bring back some of the traditions and initiatives instituted by Dan Rooney, as well as to bring some new ones forward. The NFL's 'Global Markets Program' allows the Steelers to be active across the island of Ireland. Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football. Flag is a part of the team's overall international strategy and is easy to play for young people of all ages. The Steelers also plan to enact other events, including watch parties and other football education experiences. The team is roughly two years into its NFL's 'Global Markets Program' in Mexico, and in that time, has held several in-market draft celebrations, a kicking clinic for both professional football players as well as young people, a pair of youth flag events, a large-scale watch party in Mexico City, as well as a business summit with members of the business community. We'll look to bring similar initiatives to Ireland; and plan to be thoughtful and intentional about how they are introduced.

Steelers Legends Community More than 1,700 players have worn the Black and Gold since the team was founded in 1933. Steelers players of the past paved the way for the Steelers of today and the future. The Legends Community was created by the NFL to celebrate, embrace, educate and connect all who have played in the League. A Legend is defined as a "person or thing that inspires." With less than 1 percent of high school football players eventually being drafted by an NFL team, Commissioner Roger Goodell defined an NFL Legend as anyone who "signed a contract and played at least one preseason game. Once a Player, Always a Legend." We celebrate our Steelers Legends. Many of them remain active in business and the community, and quite a few have made Pittsburgh their home. Once a Steeler, Always a Steeler. Visit this page to see what our Legends are doing now, as well as learn more about those who came before.

Los Pittsburgh Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Kansas City Chiefs el prÃ3ximo 25 de diciembre en lo que pinta para ser un partido durÃ­simo en la penÃoltima semana de temporada regular de la NFL. Los Steelers necesitan victorias en sus dos juegos restantes para asegurar el campeonato divisional pero la primera prueba no serÃ¡ nada fÃ¡cil. "Estamos honrados y emocionados de jugar en Navidad y ser parte de eso, pero tambiÃ©n estamos emocionados en estar en un juego asÃ­ de grande contra un gran equipo en nuestro estadio y regresar a nuestro trabajo y obviamente nuestro trabajo es ganar." comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin. No es casualidad que los Chiefs estÃ©n buscando su tercer anillo de manera consecutiva. Mike Tomlin hablÃ3 el domingo en conferencia de prensa ante los medios y resaltÃ3 la continuidad de Steve Spagnuolo como Coordinador Defensivo de Kansas City y los esquemas de presiÃ3n que utiliza el equipo en momentos decisivos de partidos. TambiÃ©n hablÃ3 sobre Chris Jones y lo multifacÃ©tico y clave que puede llegar a ser para el buen funcionamiento de la unidad defensiva de los Chiefs. Sobre la ofensiva de nuestro prÃ3ximo rival, sabemos de sobra lo que Patrick Mahomes puede hacer con el balÃ3n y la manera en la que sabe controlar y ganar los partidos, muchas de sus 14 victorias esta temporada han sido apretadas pero eso es lo que hacen los jugadores como Ã©l, marcan la diferencia y saben ganar partidos. Mahomes llegÃ3 con una lesiÃ3n de tobillo al partido del fin de semana pasado contra los Texans y aunque se le vio cojeando un poco en algunos momentos del partido eso no lo detuvo para salir por piernas varias veces y hasta anotar por tierra en una carrera de 15 yardas. Sobre los lesionados de Pittsburgh, hasta el momento de escribir esta nota no se sabe el status de oficial de Joey Porter (rodilla) y Ben Skowronek (cadera), quienes no pudieron terminar el partido pasado contra Baltimore. "Algunos de los jugadores que no tuvieron oportunidad de jugar ayer (vs Ravens) Justin Fields, DeShon Elliott, Donte Jackson, George Pickens y Larry Ogunjobi, todos tienen la oportunidad de jugar esta semana, dependiendo de lo que vayamos notando en la semana" comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin. Disfrutemos mucho de esta partido, que por primera vez serÃ¡ transmitido en Netflix en punto del mediodÃ­a, hora del centro de MÃ©xico.

Los Pittsburgh Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Cincinnati Bengals el prÃ3ximo sÃ¡bado por la noche en lo que serÃ¡ el Ãoltimo partido para el equipo de la temporada regular de la NFL. Los Steelers vienen de tres derrotas consecutivas y buscan sacudirse esa mala racha para llegar con otro momentum a su primer partido de playoffs. Los Ravens enfrentarÃ¡n a los Browns el mismo sÃ¡bado pero mÃ¡s temprano. Si Baltimore llega a ganar ese partido serÃ¡n campeones divisionales sin importar el resultado entre los Steelers y los Bengals, si los Ravens pierden y los Steelers le ganan a los Bengals, Pittsburgh se alzarÃ­a con la corona divisional del Norte de la Americana. Sobre el prÃ3ximo rival de los Steelers, los Cincinnati Bengals, no serÃ¡ un partido fÃ¡cil. Los Bengals todavÃ­a aspiran a un lugar en los playoffs y para eso deben salir victoriosos. La historia con Cincinnati esta temporada ha sido su defensiva, quienes no han tenido una buena campaÃ±a pero siguen peleando por un lugar en la postemporada gracias a la mÃ¡gnifica campaÃ±a que ha tenido Joe Burrow quien ha logrado por mÃ©ritos propios equilibrar esa balanza y con actuaciones muy buenas ha sacado partidos que parecÃ­an difÃ­ciles de ganar. En el primer partido de esta temporada contra los Bengals, Russell Wilson tuvo un desempeÃ±o extraordinario, lanzÃ3 para mÃ¡s de 400 yardas y tres pases de anotaciÃ3n. La ofensiva de los Steelers no ha tenido sus mejores partidos en el Ãoltimo mes y serÃ¡ importante entrar en ritmo temprano en el partido para poder remar con la corriente a favor. SerÃ¡ clave mantener el juego terrestre en alto nivel para prolongar las series ofensivas y mantener fuera del campo a Burrow, Chase, Higgins y compaÃ±Ã­a. "Hemos visto ciertas tendencias en partidos recientes y he hablado especÃ­ficamente de algunas cosas en este cuarto. Los intercambios de balÃ3n y nuestra habilidad de cuidarlo. Nuestra balanza se ha desequilibrado, lo hemos analizado y buscamos revertir eso", fue lo que comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin sobre uno de los cambios mÃ¡s importantes que debe hacer el equipo para asegurar la victoria. El partido lo podrÃ¡n disfrutar a travÃ©s de la seÃ±al de ESPN en MÃ©xico y obviamente en nuestro sitio con la voz de Ãlvaro MartÃ­n y Arturo Carlos, tambiÃ©n podrÃ¡n verlo por NFL Game Pass en DAZN en punto de las 7pm hora del Centro de MÃ©xico. Â¡Feliz aÃ±o nuevo a toda la Steeler Nation! Here we go!

Los Pittsburgh Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Baltimore Ravens en la primera ronda de los playoffs de la NFL. SerÃ¡ el tercer partido entre estos dos equipos tras sus dos enfrentamientos en duelos divisionales en los que dividieron victorias. "Jugamos contra alguien que es muy conocido por nosotros y nosotros muy conocidos por ellos, serÃ¡ la tercera ocasiÃ3n este aÃ±o y serÃ¡ en su estadio, por lo que tenemos que prepararnos mucho y estar listos para jugar", palabras de Coach Tomlin en conferencia de prensa. Para un partido como estos me gusta mucho empezar hablando de ambas defensivas. La defensiva de Pittsburgh se ha mantenido sÃ3lida pero los intercambios de balÃ3n no han llegado en los Ãoltimos partidos. En la temporada regular fueron 33 balones recuperados por nuestra unidad, siendo los lÃ­deres de la NFL junto a la defensiva de los Vikings en esta categorÃ­a. La defensiva de Ravens ha mejorado mucho desde la segunda mitad de la campaÃ±a y Mike Tomlin hizo referencia a que esa mejorÃ­a llegÃ3 gracias a su habilidad para evitar jugadas grandes en el juego aÃ©reo. Sin duda serÃ¡ un desafÃ­o para Russell Wilson y su cuerpo de receptores. Hablando de nuestro quarterback. Wilson es el segundo quarterback con mÃ¡s victorias en los playoffs de todos los presentes en la postemporada de 2024 con nueve triunfos, solamente Patrick Mahomes tiene mÃ¡s con quince. Â¿SerÃ¡ que la experiencia de Wilson ayude a la ofensiva a sacudirse las Ãoltimas presentaciones y cambie la cara en este duelo de eliminaciÃ3n directa? lo veremos el prÃ3ximo sÃ¡bado. Sobre la ofensiva que enfrentaremos sobran los adjetivos para calificar su desempeÃ±o esta temporada. Lamar Jackson sumÃ3 un aÃ±o histÃ3rico, probablemente el mejor de su temporada hasta ahora y si a eso le sumamos la doble amenaza en el juego terrestre con Derrick Henry la situaciÃ3n puede lucir complicada para la defensiva, aunque no serÃ­a la primera vez que nuestra unidad los detiene, es bien sabido que se necesitan cometer muy pocos errores y ser disciplinados en el campo a pesar de la rivalidad tan fuerte entre ambos equipos El partido lo podrÃ¡n disfrutar en MÃ©xico por Canal 5 de Televisa y por ESPN MÃ©xico el sÃ¡bado 11 de enero a las 7pm hora del centro y tambiÃ©n en nuestro sitio con la voz de Ãlvaro MartÃ­n y Arturo Carlos y NFL Game Pass por DAZN.

Steelers.com The Steelers signed running back Kenneth Gainwell to a one-year contract. Gainwell was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL Draft, the 150th overall pick, and spent the last four seasons with the Eagles. He has appeared in 66 games, including four starts, and carried the ball 280 times for 1,185 yards, a 4.2-yard average, and 12 touchdowns. Gainwell also has 102 receptions for 721 yards, a 7.1-yard average, and one touchdown. He also has 27 kickoff returns for 612 yards, a 22.7-yard average. "I love the toughness of this team, the toughness of this brand of football," said Gainwell. "And really, just Coach Mike Tomlin, I grew up watching the Steelers every Sunday, seeing the Steelers on TV and that just really drew my interest. "My brother (Kory) was a big-time fan of the Steelers. That just drew the line and got me watching the team. "And seeing what Coach Tomlin does with the running backs, for me to come in and implement my game and be the best version of myself." The Steelers faced Gainwell in a Week 15 matchup against the Eagles in 2024, when he rushed for 20 yards on seven carries, and had three receptions for 40 yards. He also had 63 kickoff return yards, for a total of 123 all-purpose yards in the game. "I bring a different game," said Gainwell of his style of play. "I can run any route out of the backfield, I can do anything out of the slot, protection, run game. Pass protection is big here and that is something I bring and can be high on." Gainwell played in all 17 games in 2024, starting one, while carrying the ball 75 times for 290 yards, a 3.9-yard average, and one touchdown. He also had 16 receptions for 116 yards, a 7.3-yard average as he helped the Eagles on special teams as well during their Super Bowl LIX season as he returned 18 kickoffs for a career-high 456 yards, a 25.3-yard average. In 2023, he played in 16 games, with two starts, and finished the season with 84 carries for a career-high 364 yards, a 4.3-yard average, and two touchdowns. He added 30 receptions for 183 yards, a 6.1-yard average. During the 2022 regular season he appeared in all 17 games, carrying the ball 53 times for 240 yards and four touchdowns, while adding 23 receptions for 169 yards, a 7.3-yard average. In the postseason, Gainwell led the Eagles with 33 carries for 181 yards, a 5.5-yard average, and a career-long 35-yard touchdown. He also had seven receptions for 55 yards, a 7.9-yard average, and his 236 yards from scrimmage also led the Eagles. In 2021, he tied for the most rushing touchdowns in franchise history for a rookie with five. He finished the season with 68 rushing attempts for 291 yards, a 4.3-yard average, and 33 receptions for 253 yards, a 7.7-yard average, and one touchdown for a total of six touchdowns for the season. Gainwell played college football at Memphis where he was a teammate of Steelers receiver Calvin Austin III. He played in 18 games at Memphis, starting 14, and had 2,212 yards from scrimmage, including 1,550 rushing yards and 662 receiving yards, with 17 touchdowns. He helped to lead Memphis to an AAC Championship in 2019 when he had an FBS-leading 2,069 all-purpose yards and 1,459 rushing yards, which ranked 12th nationally. He became the third player in Memphis history to register 2,000 plus all-purpose yards. He opted out of his final college season in 2020 after four relatives passed away due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Steelers.com The Steelers signed linebacker Malik Harrison to a two-year contract. Harrison was originally drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the third round of the 2020 NFL Draft, the 98th overall pick and has spent the last five seasons with the Ravens. Harrison has appeared in 76 career games, with 35 starts. He has 144 career tackles, 78 of them solo stops, and seven tackles for a loss. He also has two sacks, four quarterback hits, and one pass defensed. He also has 30 special teams tackles, including 17 solo stops. "It's my presence and how aggressive I am, and my versatility," said Harrison of how he fits with the Steelers defense. "I can play inside, outside. I can do it all, special teams, I'm all over the place. So that's what I think I can bring. "Special teams, I will do anything to make this team win. Special teams is a core to this game, and I feel like it's important. You've got one play, and you've got to make that one play count." Harrison plays with an edge, an aggressive approach that will have him fit right in with the defense. "I think that's just always been how I played throughout college and in high school," said Harrison. "I've always just been the guy that's very aggressive, I don't shy away from contact. I feed off of contact. If somebody gets me, I'm going to have to get you back." In 2024, he played in 15 games, with seven starts, and had a career-high 46 tackles, with 16 solo stops. He also had career-highs with two sacks, three tackles for a loss and eight special teams tackles. Harrison was part of a Ravens' defense that was ranked No. 1 against the run in 2024 (80.1 yards per game) and No. 2 in sacks (54) and fourth down efficiency (42.9%). Harrison appeared in 14 games in 2023, starting eight. He had 17 tackles, 11 of them solo stops, and three special teams tackles.

Los Pittsburgh Steelers perdieron 17-34 contra los Baltimore Ravens en el partido correspondiente a la semana 16 de la temporada regular de la NFL. El equipo perdiÃ3 la oportunidad de coronarse como campeÃ3n divisional, pero se mantienen como lÃ­deres del Norte de la Conferencia Americana y con un lugar en los playoffs asegurado. "No hicimos lo necesario para obtener la victoria. Felicito a los Ravens por su desempeÃ±o y su victoria. No controlamos el juego terrestre, nunca lo hicimos y cuando no puedes hacer eso tienes que ganar el juego con cambios de posesiÃ3n y jugadas de alto impacto, pero eso tampoco lo pudimos lograr" El no poder controlar el juego terrestre de los Ravens fue clave, Derrick Henry corriÃ3 para 162 yardas durante el partido y eso ayudÃ3 a Baltimore a controlar el partido y a desgastar a la defensiva de los Steelers. La primera mitad fue una muy de estilo de estos partidos divisionales, rÃ­spida, competida y muy pareja, los Ravens se fueron arriba 17-10. La defensiva y los equipos especiales ya habÃ­an dado seÃ±ales buenas provocando dos balones sueltos durante los dos primeros cuartos, pero en ninguna de las ocasiones lograron recuperar el ovoide. En los Ãoltimos cinco minutos del tercer cuarto Russell Wilson conectÃ3 con Cordarrelle Patterson, quiÃ©n en tres tiempos se llevÃ3 el pase de anotaciÃ3n con el que el juego se empatarÃ­a a 17. DespuÃ©s de eso los Ravens respondieron con siete puntos mÃ¡s. Con el marcador 24 - 17 a favor de los locales, Minkah Fitzpatrick interceptÃ3 un pase a Lamar Jackson que reavivÃ3 las esperanzas de los Steelers de empatar el partido en el Ãoltimo cuarto pero todo eso se derrumbÃ3 dos jugadas despuÃ©s del intercambio de balÃ3n cuando Russell Wilson fue presionado, lanzÃ3 un mal pase y Marlon Humphrey completÃ3 el pick six que separÃ3 todavÃ­a mÃ¡s el marcador 31-17. Una tarde complicada para la lÃ­nea ofensiva de Pittsburgh que permitiÃ3 3 capturas y varias jugadas forzadas por parte de Wilson debido a la presiÃ3n ejercida por la defensiva. Justin Tucker marcÃ3 la diferencia definitiva con un gol de campo que dejÃ3 el marcador 34-17 a favor de los Ravens. HabrÃ¡ que sacudirse esta derrota y dar la vuelta de inmediato porque el prÃ3ximo 25 de diciembre, en plena Navidad, los Steelers enfrentarÃ¡n a los Chiefs en un juego que puede definir el orden de los playoffs en la Conferencia Americana. Hablaremos de ese partido mÃ¡s tarde en la semana. Con la mente en los Kansas City Chiefs. Here we go!

Los Pittsburgh Steelers cayeron en casa 29-10 ante los Kansas City Chiefs en el partido correspondiente a la semana 17 en Navidad. Los Chiefs fueron superiores dentro del terreno de juego y si a eso le sumamos castigos en situaciones clave y un par de intercambios de balÃ3n muy dolorosos se puede explicar la razÃ3n de haber salido sin la victoria. "No estamos haciendo las cosas bÃ¡sicas y fundamentales de buena manera, estamos perdiendo mucho el balÃ3n y no estamos forzando intercambios a nuestro favor. No estamos generando jugadas de alto impacto y no puedes ganar un juego contra un rival de ese calibre anotando 10 puntos" comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin ante los medios de comunicaciÃ3n tras el partido. Los Steelers fueron doblegados por el brazo de Mahomes, quiÃ©n lanzÃ3 para 320 yardas y tres pases de anotaciÃ3n. La lÃ­nea ofensiva de los Chiefs luciÃ3 muy fuerte y no permitieron capturas. Del otro lado la historia fue diferente, la lÃ­nea ofensiva de los Steelers sufriÃ3 para poder proteger a Russell Wilson, quien sufriÃ3 cinco capturas en el partido. El juego arrancÃ3 bravo, los Chiefs anotaron en sus primeras dos series ofensivas y fallaron un punto extra, la diferencia era de 13 puntos, la ofensiva moviÃ3 bien el balÃ3n pero cuando llegÃ3 a zona roja, Russell Wilson lanzÃ3 una intercepciÃ3n que impactÃ3 en el marcador. Ya en el segundo cuarto Wilson anotÃ3 el Ãonico touchdown del equipo con una carrera de una yarda. El juego terrestre ahora no fue factor Najee Harris y Jaylen Warren tuvieron mÃ¡s de 70 yardas por tierra y Russell Wilson 55 yardas pero eso no fue suficiente para marcar diferencia a la ofensiva, los 10 puntos de este miÃ©rcoles contra los Chiefs es la menor cantidad de puntos de la ofensiva desde la semana 13 del 2023 contra Arizona. Hay que darle vuelta a la hoja y pensar en el cierre de campaÃ±a en contra de los Bengals y en llegar con un mejor ritmo y con los errores corregidos de camino a los playoffs en el mes de enero.

Se terminÃ3 la temporada regular para los Pittsburgh Steelers, quienes cayeron 19-17 ante los Cincinnati Bengals este sÃ¡bado por la noche en Acrisure Stadium. EstÃ¡ fue la cuarta derrota consecutiva para el equipo, que termina la temporada como segundo lugar de la DivisiÃ3n Norte de la Conferencia Americana con rÃ©cord 10-7. Los Steelers no han tenido un buen desempeÃ±o a la ofensiva el Ãoltimo mes, de hecho en este partido la ofensiva no habÃ­a llegado a las 100 yardas entrado ya el Ãoltimo cuarto del partido. El juego terrestre no funcionÃ3 y de no ser por el extraordinario partido de Pat Freiermuth ( 8 recepciones, 85 yardas, 1 touchdown), el juego aÃ©reo tampoco tuvo un desempeÃ±o bueno. George Pickens regresÃ3 de su lesiÃ3n pero no se viÃ3 como Ã©l mismo y tuvo solamente una recepciÃ3n sin yardas ganadas y tres drops en ocho targets. "Particularmente del lado ofensivo del balÃ3n no hicimos las jugadas necesarias, no tuvimos fluidez, no convertimos las jugadas importantes, no anotamos", palabras de Mike Tomlin en conferencia de prensa tras el partido. El primer touchdown de los Steelers fue apenas en la segunda serie ofensiva del partido con un acarreo de una yarda de Najee Harris, la segunda anotaciÃ3n de los Steelers fue en el Ãoltimo cuarto con un pase de 19 yardas de Russell Wilson a Freiermuth. Del otro lado la defensiva nos mantuvo con vida durante todo el partido. En el primer cuarto le interceptaron a Joe Burrow un pase en el que buscaba a Chase pero Patrick Queen logrÃ3 desviar el balÃ3n y Beanie Bishop se lo llevÃ3. La situaciÃ3n en el final de la primera mitad en la que la ofensiva no logrÃ3 convertir una cuarta oportunidad y una yarda por avanzar le dio la oportunidad a los Bengals de sumar tres puntos claves en el marcador final y sobre esa decisiÃ3n Mike Tomlin comentÃ3: "No querÃ­a entregarles el balÃ3n con tiempos fuera en el reloj y decidimos ser agresivos en esa situaciÃ3n, si no logras avanzar una yarda en esa situaciÃ3n no mereces ganar y eso fue lo que sucediÃ3 hoy." En la segunda mitad la defensiva se vio muy fuerte, lograron contener a Burrow y la secundaria logrÃ3 ajustar bien, el partido se emparejÃ3. Los equipos especiales recuperaron un balÃ3n suelto en una patada de despeje que resultÃ3 en tres puntos mÃ¡s para Pittsburgh. La defensiva logrÃ3 detener a Burrow una vez mÃ¡s y con la ofensiva de dos minutos el equipo entregÃ3 el balÃ3n por oportunidades tras no poder convertir una cuarta y doce. Shoutout a Cameron Heyward, quien tuvo un gran partido defendiendo tres pases. TambiÃ©n cuatro de nuestros defensivos registraron una captura cada uno (Queen, Herbig, Benton y Smith). Con los resultados del fin de semana los Steelers se encuentran como el sexto sembrado de la AFC, enfrentarÃ¡n a los Ravens en Baltimore el sÃ¡bado 11 de Enero a las 7 p.m. hora del centro de MÃ©xico. En la semana tendremos mucho mÃ¡s informaciÃ3n de lo que viene para los playoffs. Here we go!

La Liga Nacional de FÃotbol Americano jugarÃ¡ su primer partido de temporada regular en DublÃ­n, Irlanda, en 2025, anunciÃ3 la liga el viernes. Los Pittsburgh Steelers jugarÃ¡n como el equipo local en el partido histÃ3rico. El partido de la NFL DublÃ­n 2025 se llevarÃ¡ a cabo en Croke Park, el estadio deportivo mÃ¡s grande de Irlanda y sede de la AsociaciÃ3n AtlÃ©tica GaÃ©lica (GAA), en asociaciÃ3n con el Gobierno de Irlanda y el Ayuntamiento de DublÃ­n. El presidente de los Steelers, Art Rooney II, y su familia tienen una rica historia y una profunda conexiÃ3n con la isla de Irlanda, ya que tienen familiares de Newry, County Down. El difunto presidente de los Steelers, Daniel M. Rooney, padre de Art Rooney, se desempeÃ±Ã3 como embajador de los EE. UU. en Irlanda de 2009 a 2012 y fue cofundador de la organizaciÃ3n benÃ©fica "Ireland Funds." Los Steelers tambiÃ©n son uno de los dos Ãonicos equipos de la NFL que han jugado un partido en Irlanda hasta la fecha, un enfrentamiento de pretemporada en 1997 contra los Chicago Bears en Croke Park como parte de la serie American Bowl. "Estamos encantados de traer oficialmente un partido de temporada regular de la NFL a Irlanda como parte de nuestra programaciÃ3n de juegos Internacionales de 2025", dijo el vicepresidente ejecutivo internacional, eventos, y negocios de clubes de la NFL, Peter O'Reilly. "Tanto la NFL como la franquicia de los Steelers tienen raÃ­ces profundas e historia en Irlanda, y estamos ansiosos por hacer nuestro debut en la temporada regular en DublÃ­n, llevando nuestro juego a una gran y apasionada base de aficionados irlandeses y subrayando el compromiso de la NFL con el crecimiento global". "Estamos muy emocionados de ser el equipo designado en el primer partido de temporada regular que se jugarÃ¡ en Irlanda esta prÃ3xima temporada", dijo el presidente de los Steelers, Art Rooney II. "La oportunidad para los Pittsburgh Steelers de jugar en Irlanda es realmente especial, no solo por la historia de la familia Rooney allÃ­, sino tambiÃ©n por jugar frente al creciente nÃomero de aficionados de los Steelers en Irlanda. Estamos encantados de ser parte de este evento histÃ3rico para representar a Pittsburgh en un juego que acerca la NFL a los grandes aficionados de los deportes en Irlanda". Sobre un juego en MÃ©xico en el futuro, Art Rooney II aÃ±adiÃ3, "Hemos hablado sobre nuestro deseo de jugar un partido en MÃ©xico muchas veces en los Ãoltimos aÃ±os y eso no ha cambiado. Nos encantarÃ­a jugar un partido frente a nuestros fanÃ¡ticos en MÃ©xico pronto y trabajaremos con la NFL para hacer lo que podamos para ayudar a que eso se haga realidad". Croke Park ha sido anfitriÃ3n de muchos momentos deportivos icÃ3nicos. Es la sede de la GAA, las finales irlandesas de fÃotbol gaÃ©lico y hurling, en 2003 se llevaron a cabo las ceremonias de apertura y clausura de las Olimpiadas Especiales y en 1996 se llevÃ3 a cabo el partido de fÃotbol universitario entre Notre Dame y la Marina. AdemÃ¡s de su herencia deportiva, el lugar ha recibido a Ã­conos musicales globales como U2, Bruce Springsteen, Coldplay y Taylor Swift.

Los Pittsburgh Steelers cayeron 28 -14 contra los Baltimore Ravens en el partido de la ronda de comodines de los playoffs de la NFL y con eso concluye su participaciÃ3n en la temporada 2024. Los Steelers tuvieron una primera mitad para el olvido en la que se fueron 21-0 abajo en el marcador, con una ofensiva inoperante y una defensiva incapaz de frenar el juego terrestre de los Ravens. "El factor X fue el talento Ãonico de Lamar (Jackson), cada prueba que tenÃ­a frente a Ã©l la superÃ3 y tampoco encontramos fluidez en nuestra ofensiva, destacando nuestra inhabilidad de convertir en terceras oportunidades durante la primera mitad y eso provocÃ3 que el equipo se desgastara." palabras de Mike Tomlin en conferencia de prensa. Sobre el juego terrestre de los Ravens nuestro head coach comentÃ3 "Cuando juegas 11 contra 11 con un qb asÃ­ de mÃ3vil y no haces una tacleada cuando debes, las cosas pueden salir mal, ese ha sido su modo de jugar y si sumas eso a todo el tiempo que la defensiva pasÃ3 dentro del campo el resultado es ese." Los Ravens tuvieron 299 yardas por tierra, 186 de esas yardas de Derrick Henry. Los Steelers solamente tuvieron 29 yardas por tierra en todo el partido. En la segunda mitad del partido los Steeler tuvieron una clara mejorÃ­a en ambas caras del balÃ3n, la ofensiva pudo anotar en dos ocasiones una con Van Jefferson y otra con George Pickens, quien tuvo un gran partido con cinco recepciones y 87 yardas. "La manera en la que liderÃ3 al equipo para salir en la segunda mitad fue increÃ­ble pero su actuaciÃ3n como la de todo el equipo no fue suficientemente buena para ganar.", fue lo que comentÃ3 Coach Tomlin sobre Rusell Wilson y su liderazgo nato. Rusell Wilson hablÃ3 ante los medios y seÃ±alÃ3 lo siguiente, "No nos rendimos nunca, la mentalidad en la segunda mitad fue otra y por eso estoy muy orgulloso de todos los chicos en el locker, nunca dejaron de pelear." Los Pittsburgh Steelers terminan su participaciÃ3n en la temporada y ahora no queda mÃ¡s que seguir trabajando para mejorar la prÃ3xima temporada y ver todo lo que nos depara la pretemporada entre las piezas de ajedrez que se moverÃ¡n. AquÃ­ tendremos siempre toda la informaciÃ3n. Gracias por una temporada mÃ¡s por su preferencia y por seguir apoyando a los Pittsburgh Steelers. Here we go!

Steelers.com The Steelers acquired receiver DK Metcalf in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks. The Steelers will send the Seahawks their second round pick (52nd overall) and seventh round pick (223rd overall) in the 2025 NFL Draft, and receive the Seahawks sixth-round pick (185th overall) in the 2025 NFL Draft. Metcalf also signed a new five-year contract with the team. Metcalf was drafted by the Seahawks in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft and spent the last six seasons in Seattle. In those six seasons, he has appeared in 97 games, starting 93 of them, and has 438 receptions for 6,324 yards, a 14.4-yard average, and 48 touchdowns, which rank eighth-most among active players in the NFL. He has three touchdowns longer than 70 yards, including a career long 84-yard touchdown. Metcalf has 15 100-yard games, including one against the Steelers in 2023, and a career-high 177 yards receiving against the Philadelphia Eagles in 2020. He also has two 100-yard receiving games in the postseason. He also has three 1,000-yard seasons and has 13 catches of 50 yards or more in his career, which ranks seventh among active receivers.. Metcalf was a second-team Associated Press All-Pro selection in 2020 and a two-time Pro Bowl selection in 2020 and 2023. In 2024, Metcalf appeared in 15 games, starting 12 of them. He had 66 receptions for 992 yards, a 15-yard average, and five touchdowns. Metcalf became one of only two players in NFL history, along with Hall of Famer Randy Moss, with 50 receptions, 900 yards and five touchdowns in each of their first six seasons. He also became the first player in Seahawks history with three consecutive 100-yard games, doing so in Weeks 2-4. He ranks first in Seahawks' history with receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns in his first six seasons and is fourth on the franchise's all-time receiving list. Metcalf had his third 1,000-yard season in 2023 when he started 16 games, pulling in 66 receptions for 1,114 yards and eight touchdowns, including a 73-yard touchdown, which was Seattle's longest play from scrimmage for the season. His 1,114 yards made him the seventh player in Seahawks history with back-to-back 1,000 yard receiving seasons. He set a single-season career-high in 2022 when he had 90 receptions, which were fourth-most in Seahawks history. He also turned in his second 1,000-yard season, pulling in 90 receptions for 1,048 yards and six touchdowns. Metcalf led the Seahawks with 75 receptions in 2021, while adding a team-high 12 touchdowns, which ranked fourth in the NFL and were tied for third-most in a single-season for the Seahawks. He had a career-long 84-yard touchdown against New Orleans, the third-longest reception in team history. In 2020, Metcalf posted his first 1,000-yard season when he had 83 receptions for a career-high 1,303 yards and 10 touchdowns, while being named second-team AP All-Pro and being selected to the Pro Bowl. The 1,303 receiving yards were a team record, passing Steve Largent who held the previous record of 1,287 yards. It didn't take Metcalf long to make an impact, with 58 receptions for 900 yards and seven touchdowns in 2019. His 58 receptions were second among all NFL rookie receivers, while his 900 receiving yards were third. Both the receptions and yardage numbers were second all-time in Seahawks' single-season history by a rookie. Metcalf played college football at Ole Miss, where he started 19 of 21 games played before leaving after his redshirt sophomore year. He had 67 receptions for 1,228 yards and 14 touchdowns.

Contributing Writer/Editor The Steelers signed cornerback Darius Slay to a one-year deal following his release by the Philadelphia Eagles. Slay, who turned 34 Jan. 1, has been a key member of Philadelphia's secondary since 2020 after a successful run with the Detroit Lions.p A six-time Pro Bowl player, Slay has 28 interceptions and 160 pass breakups in his 12-year NFL career. Though he did not record an interception in 2024, he had 13 pass breakups. Slay, a second-round draft pick of Detroit in 2013, is a willing tackler who will mix it up with opposing offensive players. He also excels at man coverage. In his career, he's allowed just 59.5 percent of passes thrown in his direction to be completed. Last season, opponents completed 60.4 percent of the passes they attempted in Slay's coverage, showing his coverage abilities have not slipped. Over the course of his career, Slay has been one of the few cornerbacks in the league who travels with the opponent's No. 1 receiving option. With the Steelers, he'll offer a solid option on the opposite side of third-year cornerback Joey Porter Jr. and give Porter a veteran former No. 1 cornerback from which to continue to learn the tricks of the trade. And with Slay on board, Porter won't be forced to follow the opposing team's No. 1 receiving threat unless the Steelers choose to do so. Slay has missed eight games over the past two seasons after previously being a very durable player over the course of his career. Despite missing those starts, Slay has played over 800 defensive snaps in every season since 2014. When he's healthy, he seldom comes off the football field. But with third-year cornerback Corey Trice also on the roster, the acquisition of Slay gives the Steelers three very viable outside cornerback options. Trice, like Porter, also can learn plenty from Slay, perhaps benefitting the Steelers for years to come.

Contributing Writer/Editor The Steelers have acquired two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks via trade. The move gives the Steelers the upgrade at wide receiver the team has been searching for since the 2024 offseason. Metcalf, who turned 27 in December, is one of the top big-play wide receivers in the NFL. At 6-foot-4, 235 pounds, he is a massive mismatch for most NFL cornerbacks. Metcalf also ran a 4.33-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2019 while also posting a 40 Â1⁄2-inch vertical leap. His 40 time set a Combine record for the fastest by a player weighing more than 225 pounds. His explosiveness has translated to the NFL, as Metcalf has had at least 900 receiving yards in all six of his NFL seasons, surpassing 1,000 yards three times. His best season came in 2020 â with Russell Wilson at quarterback â when he caught 83 passes for 1,303 yards and 10 touchdowns. In 2024, Metcalf had 66 receptions for 992 yards and five touchdowns in 15 games. In his career, he has 438 catches for 6,324 yards and 48 touchdowns, playing in 97 of a possible 100 games. He's averaged 14.4 yards per reception in his career, including 15.0 in 2024. Metcalf has been even better in the postseason, catching 26 passes for 451 yards and five touchdowns in four playoff games, an average of nearly 113 yards per game. Joining Metcalf with incumbent outside receiver George Pickens, the Steelers will boast one of the biggest and most explosive starting duos in the NFL. In 2024, Metcalf ran 85 percent of his routes split wide, averaging 13.7 yards per air target, with 26 percent of his targets being 20 or more yards downfield. Pickens ran 80 percent of his routes split wide in 2024, averaging 13.5 yards per target with 29 percent of his targets coming 20 or more yards downfield. Metcalf ran a vertical route on 53.6 percent of his routes in 2024, the highest rate in his career. He recorded 503 yards on those routes, third-most in the NFL. On Go routes in particular, he gained 374 yards, second-most in the league behind only Minnesota's Justin Jefferson (387).

Metcalf didn't disappoint in his rookie season even after sliding in the draft. It's raised the expectations for what many are expecting to be a breakout season for Seattle's second-year wide receiver. (AP Photo/Scott Eklund, File) Since Metcalf entered the NFL, not wide receiver has gained more yards on Go routes than Metcalf's 1,765 yards. A second-round pick in 2019 â two picks before the Steelers selected Dontae Johnson â Metcalf ranks fifth in receiving touchdowns, 12th in receiving yards and 16th in receptions in that span. In a 2019 NFL Draft that also included Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, Johnson, Marquise Brown and A.J. Brown, Metcalf ranks third in receptions and yards and second in touchdowns.

Contributing Writer/Editor The Steelers signed former Baltimore linebacker Malik Harrison to a two-year deal in free agency. Harrison, 27, enters his sixth NFL season as a special teams ace with starter capability. The 6-foot-3, 255-pound Ohio State product appeared in 76 career games with the Ravens, 34 of them starts. In 2024, the Ravens inserted Trenton Simpson into the starting lineup to replace Patrick Queen after he was signed in free agency by the Steelers. But the defense turned around in the second half of the season when the Ravens turned to Harrison to start the final seven games. Harrison played a career-best 382 defensive snaps, helping to settle things down on the second level for the Ravens. He finished the season with 54 tackles, two sacks and three tackles for a loss.

(AP Photo/Terrance Williams) Cleveland Browns place kicker Cade York (3) has his field goal attempt blocked by Baltimore Ravens linebacker Malik Harrison (40) in the second half of an NFL football game, Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Harrison has the length to fill a role as a reserve edge rusher and the athleticism to play off the ball in space. A former third-round pick, Harrison ran a 4.66-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2020, also posting a 36-inch vertical jump. He's never played fewer than 288 snaps on special teams in his five NFL seasons and has topped 300 snaps on special teams in each of the past three seasons. With special teams ace Tyler Matakevich an unrestricted free agent and Elandon Roberts having signed with the Raiders, Harrison would figure to slide into that role with the capability of stepping into the lineup, if necessary, as a downhill thumper. He finished second on the Ravens with eight special teams tackles in 2024. With the NFL toying with the idea of tweaking its kickoff rules even more â including pushing the kickoff spot back five yards â to create more kick returns in 2025, having big, fast players who can run could become critical on those units. Harrison would fit the bill in that respect. Covering kickoffs was the one area where the Steelers struggled on special teams in 2024 as they -- and the rest of the NFL -- adjusted to the new kickoff rules.

Women of Steel is the Pittsburgh Steelers' platform celebrating the NFL's largest female fanbase. Through exclusive events, contests and content, our mission is to unite women from all walks of life who share a passion for the Black and Gold. Whether you're a die-hard Steelers fan or just started rooting for us, Women of Steel offers a community where you can connect, engage, and learn alongside other women of Steelers Nation. OUR PILLARS PNC SMALL BUSINESS SPOTLIGHT In Pittsburgh, small businesses are the backbone of our region, representing the determination we have to offer. In partnership with PNC, the Women of Steel Small Business Spotlight program will receive support from executives at PNC and the Pittsburgh Steelers, providing mentorship to women-owned small businesses while utilizing the Steelers platform to bring awareness to them.â Both organizations believe in a world where women transform companies and push society forward. This program is finding ways to support females, drive them to the top, and keep them climbing.â Stories Like Me Helen Campbell / Co-Owner and CEO Helen Campbell (she/her) and Imogen Campbell Hendricks (she/her) - co-owners, business partners, and mom and daughter team - are thrilled to be selected as Women of Steel. Stories Like Me is an indie bookstore for children through young adults, a community hub, and a safe space where all people can find themselves represented in books. To build their business, Helen and Imogen drew on their love of stories, along with their skills as project management professionals and musicians (musicians are very detail-oriented!). Before opening their brick-and-mortar store in Greenfield in November 2022, they did small pop-ups all throughout Pittsburgh to bring diverse stories into the community. Helen, a native of England began her career in film and TV, after which she worked as a project manager, brings all her Jedi/Mary Poppins-type super powers to making sure all kids and families can see themselves in stories. Imogen, named after a character from Shakespeare, reads everything voraciously, writes, organizes, and loves trying out boutique gins! They find their joy and passion through finding stories for all of our kids and families. Fierce Knockouts Karin Christoff / Owner Karin, a proud mother of two teenage boys and married to a fellow veteran, brings a unique journey to her business. Originally from Peru, she arrived in the U.S. with no English skills but, through much sacrifice, learned by attending night school. She served as a U.S. Army soldier and was deployed to Afghanistan.

Fairclaugh, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning emerged from a deeply personal journey. What began as a heartfelt tradition of creating custom gifts for Jarmele's beloved grandmother, who resided in a nursing facility, has grown into a thriving business dedicated to celebrating life's special moments. Jarmele's mission started with simple acts of loveâgift-wrapping chocolates, clothing, and shoes to bring a smile to her grandmother's face. Her grandmother, a cherished beacon of joy and strength in the family following the passing of Jarmele's mother, inspired the creation of Mele's Gifts & Party Planning. Following her grandmother's passing, Jarmele's familyâher son Michael and husband Markâencouraged her to turn her passion into a business. They established a website and business cards, and with their support, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning was born. Today, Mele's Gifts & Party Planning is proud to be part of a vibrant community of woman-owned businesses and is honored to be recognized as a Woman of Steel by the Pittsburgh Steelers and PNC Bank. We specialize in custom-created gifts and exceptional event planning, dedicated to turning your ideas into reality and making every occasion memorable.

Pittsburgh is a great city to visit, but especially for senior travelers exploring without children. It’s a very drivable city if you have a car. Or, you can easily order an Uber or Lyft if you arrived by Amtrak. Best of all, parking is plentiful around your favorite spots. If you love art and museums, this is your town. The Andy Warhol Museum on the North Shore reflects the Pittsburgh-born artist’s life with an eccentric artistic touch. Make sure you catch a glimpse of one of his most famous pieces, Campbell’s Soup Cans. You also can view many of his personal items, including a collection of wigs. Head across town to The Frick Pittsburgh in Point Breeze to enjoy a legacy of art, history and nature. The Car and Carriage Museum, included in The Frick’s free admission, is a ride through history. Plan accordingly so you can take your time and enjoy a leisurely stroll through the mansion, the museum and garden areas. Up for more walking? Make sure you include a visit to the Strip District where you’ll find a variety of shopping, including lots of black and gold merchandise, eclectic food and restaurant offerings and gift shops. Be on the lookout for The Strip Mural by artists Carley Parris and Shannon Pultz – it’s easily viewed on Penn Ave. For those wishing to savor all the flavors of the Strip District – or a handful of other Pittsburgh neighborhoods – consider booking a walking food tour with ‘Burgh Bits & Bites. Sports fans are in luck in Pittsburgh! The city is home to several professional teams, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Penguins, and the locals are fanatical for their favorite sports teams. You can find a large area devoted to the teams at the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, located inside the Senator John Heinz History Museum. The Heinz History Museum pays tribute to more than the local sports teams. Here, you can learn so much about one of Pittsburgh’s most famous citizens, Mister Rogers, a national treasure. Find his monogrammed house slippers and one of his beloved red cardigans. The museum also is full of American history following the democracy of the country. When your legs need a respite from walking, rest assured there are several more relaxing ways to see the city. Book a tour on Molly’s Trolleys Pittsburgh. Not only will you visit several neighborhoods and see many of the city’s popular sites, but thanks to the fantastic tour guides, you also will learn a bit of regional history. One such nugget learned on a recent trip - ketchup wasn’t the first Heinz product produced; bottled horseradish was! Ride the Duquesne Incline up to the Mount Washington neighborhood for a spectacular view of the city. A quick ride back down will drop you off in the South Side neighborhood. Pittsburgh is widely known for its three rivers. Tour the city by water aboard the Gateway Clipper Fleet. Sit back and relax on the Three Rivers Sightseeing Cruise, which allows visitors a close view of the Downtown skyline and several of the city’s 446 bridges. And, the sunset cruises are a great option for a romantic night out. Speaking of those bridges, many of them are easily walkable, connecting Downtown to several of Pittsburgh’s 90 unique neighborhoods. In fact, the Sixth Street Bridge, commonly known as the Clemente Bridge, directly takes you from Downtown to PNC Park, home of the Pirates. Consider extending your Pittsburgh visit with a daytrip to the Laurel Highlands, where you can visit two of Frank Lloyd Wright’s most iconic homes, Fallingwater and Kentuck Knob. Visiting these residences is like stepping back in time, as the décor reflects the decade each house was built. When available, make sure you book a guided tour, as they provide an insider’s look at Mr. Wright’s thought processes, as well as the homeowners’. Visitors have their pick of comfortable lodging options in Pittsburgh, including several that are housed in historical buildings, like the Drury Plaza Hotel Pittsburgh Downtown which is a beautiful renovation of the Federal Reserve Bank building. Many pieces remain from the original bank including vault doors estimated to weigh 34 tons each. The property is located Downtown and within easy walking distance of many attractions, restaurants and Union Station. The Omni William Penn Hotel also makes for a lovely stay. The iconic hotel is home to Lawrence Welk’s original bubble machine. Plus, it’s also where Bob Hope proposed to his wife, Delores. Pittsburgh is a walkable city that offers visitors a chance to see spectacular sights, gain incredible knowledge at spectacular museums and attractions and indulge in tasty treats at their own pace. Make sure a visit to the City of Bridges is on your travel list soon! Contributing Author Rosemary Palmer is the owner and author of My Home and Travels blog.

Pittsburgh Area Farmers' Markets and U-Pick Farms Pittsburgh food has always been rooted in tradition and fresh off the farm. As a result, farmers' markets are a well established part of Pittsburgh culture. There are more farmers' markets and community gardens per capita in Pittsburgh than in most U.S. metropolitan areas. In season, you can find one just about every day of the week in different neighborhoods. Whether it's a church parking lot, a sidewalk stand, or a tent off the side of the road, these markets sell local farm fresh produce, eggs, cheese, homemade baked goods, jams and honey. Some farmers' markets even sell Amish-made wood furniture and rugs. For a complete list of Pittsburgh area farmers' markets, click here. If you want to get a little closer to your food, try harvesting your own produce at Pittsburgh area U-Pick Farms. You'll get some exercise as well as a great big bunch of fresh produce you picked yourself. Visiting a u-pick farm is a great family experience that is both fun and educational. There's something about harvesting your own food that makes you appreciate it more. Many U-Pick farms also have on-site stores selling other ready-to-go products from their farm. Many Pittsburgh area residents enter in to a more formal agreement with local farmers to ensure their seasonal supply of farm fresh products; including farm fresh beef and other meats. This is a relatively new and growing trend called, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). These agreements, and the products offered, vary by farm and help local families enjoy a variety of farm fresh products while providing local farmers a profitable outlet for their harvest. 72 0 Saved
