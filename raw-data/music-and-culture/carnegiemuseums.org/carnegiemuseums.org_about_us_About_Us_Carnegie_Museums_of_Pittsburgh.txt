There’s no cultural organization in the world quite like Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. With a legacy of discovery and outreach dating back to 1895, today we are a family of four diverse, dynamic museums: Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Science Center, and The Andy Warhol Museum. We’re committed to being inclusive, both on-site and online, and to exploring with our audiences the big ideas and issues of our time.

Our mission: To preserve and expand the resources of art and science as agents of personal growth and social advancement in Pittsburgh and beyond.

Our Core Values.

Our Vision for Impact.
