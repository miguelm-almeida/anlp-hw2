Teachers are invited to join the History Center Learning Team for a night of education enrichment at the Spring Educator Open House.

Explore five floors of Western Pennsylvania history and get an exclusive tour of our new exhibit, Pittsburgh’s Hidden History. Discover resources specifically designed for classrooms and learn about the many opportunities that the History Center offers you and your students. Meet curators, archivists, and museum educators as you learn more about the work we do to support Western Pennsylvania students.

The open house is free for educators with advance registration. For an additional fee, teachers can receive 2.5 hours of Act 48 credits. The first 50 teachers to register will receive Act 48 credits for no additional charge.
