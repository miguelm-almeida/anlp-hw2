Steelers Legends Community

More than 1,700 players have worn the Black and Gold since the team was founded in 1933. Steelers players of the past paved the way for the Steelers of today and the future.

The Legends Community was created by the NFL to celebrate, embrace, educate and connect all who have played in the League. A Legend is defined as a "person or thing that inspires." With less than 1 percent of high school football players eventually being drafted by an NFL team, Commissioner Roger Goodell defined an NFL Legend as anyone who "signed a contract and played at least one preseason game. Once a Player, Always a Legend."

We celebrate our Steelers Legends. Many of them remain active in business and the community, and quite a few have made Pittsburgh their home. Once a Steeler, Always a Steeler.

Visit this page to see what our Legends are doing now, as well as learn more about those who came before.
