The Frick Pittsburgh is an exceptional example of a planned gift at its most generous—Helen Clay Frick left provisions in her will for Clayton, her childhood family home, to be restored and opened to the public along with The Frick Art Museum and the family’s car and carriage collection. That foresight has enabled The Frick Pittsburgh to evolve into the unique museum we have today.     You, too, can create a legacy that will help ensure that the Frick continues to serve students and families well into the future. In addition to making a difference in the lives of others, a planned gift can provide tax savings or income benefits for you and your family. There are many ways to make such a gift—simple methods include gifts in your will or living trust, gifts of life insurance, gifts of retirement assets, and more.   To make the process of legacy giving easy, The Frick has partnered with FreeWill for our community to create an estate plan for free. FreeWill’s secure online tool empowers you to write a legally valid will or trust in about 20 minutes. As you write your will, FreeWill presents you with the opportunity to make a planned gift to The Frick on your terms.   If you have ‘non-probate’ assets like a life insurance policy that you’d like to donate, you can use this FreeWill tool to log all of these assets and name The Frick as a beneficiary.    If you have already created a legacy by including a gift in your estate plan, will you please complete this form to let us know? This helps us update our records and thank you for building a legacy to support The Frick’s authentic experiences with art, history, and nature.

Dr. Moitra understands the impact that art, history, and nature can have on someone. As a graduate student, Moitra appreciated the ability to come and visit the The Frick Art Museum for free when he didn’t have many resources. “I think it’s so important to have this opportunity, especially if you’re interested in art but can’t afford to pay the price of admission,” Moitra says.     As an adult, Moitra retained his love of art and was compelled to join the Frick as a member, remembering the effect the museums had on him in his younger years. Thinking about his own legacy, he also decided to make a planned gift to the Frick, knowing that his gift would make it possible for future generations of students to visit, as he had.     The Frick has been a key part of Dr. Moitra’s life for many years, and he feels it is important to give back, support the future of the institution, and ensure that anyone can find sanctuary on our campus. We are so thankful for members like Dr. Moitra, who have a positive impact on everything we do here.

While some prefer to leave a gift in their wills or estates, others appreciate the increased flexibility of a beneficiary designation. You might consider using:
