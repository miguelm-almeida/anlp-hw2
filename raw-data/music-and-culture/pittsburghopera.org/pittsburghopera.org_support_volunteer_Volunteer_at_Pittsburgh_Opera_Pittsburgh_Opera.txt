Because opera includes all the arts, it provides rich opportunities to experience and observe artists of all kinds. Volunteers who give their time and expertise at Pittsburgh Opera learn, while "working in the wings," the amazing amount of effort and skill it takes to produce opera.

Pittsburgh Opera occasionally needs volunteers at events and for special projects. During an individual interview, we determine if a volunteer’s interests and skills match Pittsburgh Opera’s needs.

If you are interested in volunteering, email Marilyn Michalka Egan, Ph.D., Director of Education, or call her at 412-281-0912 ext. 242.
