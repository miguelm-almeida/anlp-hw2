Our signature program is a unique, fun, and stimulating professional learning opportunity for teachers of all grade levels in all content areas.

Workshop topics include the five 2024–2025 season operas plus additional arts integration materials so that teachers have additional resources to use in their classes. Each workshop is recorded so that participants can attend live or at a later time. We include live presentations and/or performances by resident artists. And, we provide some of the workshop materials in advance for participants to explore at their convenience, so the actual “live” workshop time is short and engaging.

The 1.5 hour workshops are on Saturday mornings from 10:30 am–12:00 pm via Zoom, with a one hour optional networking time afterward.

There is no cost to attend the workshop. Pre-registration is required a week in advance by emailing: megan@pittsburghopera.org

Opera Academy members receive a full season subscription, nine workshops, and a student performance or Opera Trunk presentation. In return, Opera Academy members document how they use opera in their classes.
