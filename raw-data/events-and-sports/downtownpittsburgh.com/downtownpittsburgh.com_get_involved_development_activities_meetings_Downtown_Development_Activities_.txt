The Downtown Development Activities Meetings (DAM) is a forum available for residents, business owners, property owners, and other stakeholders to learn more about proposed Downtown development projects and provide feedback before the project can move forward in the City’s planning and approval process.

As a Registered Community Organization (RCO) for Downtown, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership (PDP) will host public meetings to review upcoming projects in Downtown before they are reviewed by applicable City of Pittsburgh commissions and boards, allowing your feedback to be heard early in the planning process. View a map of the PDP’s RCO boundary here.

All meetings will take place at least thirty (30) days prior to the applicant’s first public hearing.

The next DAM is scheduled for Thursday, March 13 at 5:00 PM via Zoom.
