The CMU Crowdfunding platform is designated for university-related projects that impact and benefit CMU students and/or other entities within the CMU community, and with funding goals of $2,000-$10,000.

Project leaders and teams must be directly affiliated with CMU (i.e. students, alumni, faculty, and staff).

No, at this time individuals cannot use CMU crowdfunding to cover research costs.

A crowdfunding campaign requires significant investment from the project leaders to be successful. Project Leaders need to submit the application, attend the virtual orientation, create a project page, develop a communication plan and actively fundraise for the length of the campaign (~30 days.) The Office of Annual Giving can be a resource for all groups, as it supports all crowdfunding projects throughout the campaign.
