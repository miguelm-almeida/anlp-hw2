Join Dr. Edda Fields-Black for an examination of untold stories and reclaimed histories through her most recent book, COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid and Black Freedom during the Civil War. COMBEE explores Harriet Tubman’s often-overlooked role in the largest slave rebellion in US history that resulted in the liberation of 756 people from bondage on seven rice plantations. Through previously unexamined sources, Dr. Fields-Black—herself a descendent of a soldier who fought in the raid—brings to life the Combahee River Raid and the untold stories of those freed, their resilience, and the lasting impact of Tubman’s heroism.

Following the book talk, enjoy a light reception and book signing with the author as well as access to Kara Walker: Harper’s Pictorial History of the Civil War (Annotated). Ticket price includes exhibition admission, advanced registration required.

Dr. Edda L. Fields-Black is a Professor in the Department of History and the Director of the Dietrich College Humanities Center at Carnegie Mellon University.
