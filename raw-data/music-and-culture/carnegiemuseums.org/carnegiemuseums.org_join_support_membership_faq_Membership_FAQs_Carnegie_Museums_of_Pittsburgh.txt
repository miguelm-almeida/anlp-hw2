Your membership includes the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh:

Carnegie Museum of Art

Carnegie Museum of Natural History

Carnegie Science Center (including Highmark SportsWorks®)

The Andy Warhol Museum

Members receive a 10% discount in all four museum stores and cafes. In addition, members receive discounts on select classes, camps, and lectures (member pricing is listed when applicable).

Members enjoy exhibition previews, exclusive tours, lectures, and more! Please visit our member events page for a list of upcoming events.

Carnegie Science Center participates in the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) Passport Program which offers free or discounted admission to participating science centers and museums that are beyond a 90-mile radius of Pittsburgh and your home address.*

Just show your Carnegie Museums membership card and a photo ID for admission at ASTC institutions. We recommend calling before you visit, as the list of reciprocal museums may change without notice.

Premium level members and above also receive reciprocal admission to a list of select art and natural history museums. View the list here.

Immediately!

Individual: Only the cardholder receives admission under the membership.

Dual: Covers admission for two adults or one adult and one child. If only one cardholder is visiting, a guest child or adult may accompany him or her.

Family: Covers admission for two adults and up to four children. At Carnegie Museums, we want all children to enjoy the museums, so feel free to bring your children’s friends, your nieces and nephews, or your neighbors.

Premium: Covers admission for two adults and up to eight guests per visit. This is a great option for large families! One of the designated cardholders must be present to accompany guests.

Note: You can bring guests to member events just like you bring guests for a museum visit. If your membership does not allow for guests and you would like to bring more people, you can upgrade to a higher level by calling 412.622.3314.

Our membership levels cover people, not households, so if you would like another family member to use your membership, please list them as one of the designated adults. Depending on your membership level, they may accompany you to the museum as a guest.

Memberships are not transferable: Adults not accompanied by a cardholder will not be admitted under the membership.

Free membership admission does not apply to group visits, field trips, or special programs such as 21+ Night due to additional programming and expenses related to these visits.

Designated adults on the membership can visit without their card. Simply show a valid photo ID at the admissions counter. Member children visiting without a designated adult or caregiver MUST have a membership card to gain admission under the membership.

Use your 10% discount on unique and fun gifts from all four of our Carnegie Museums stores.

To receive your member discount on our online store, just enter code CMPMember in the Coupon box on the cart or checkout page and click Apply.

Your optional Carnegie Digital Membership Card is an app that can be accessed on your smartphone.

The Carnegie Digital Membership Card is optional. If you don’t wish to download the card, simply disregard the message and you won’t be offered this feature until you renew your membership.

Yes, you will still receive a physical Carnegie Membership Card whether or not you opt-in to the Carnegie Digital Membership Card.

iPhone- Access the email from your smartphone and click the “Download” button, then click “Add to Wallet” and “Add.” The card will automatically go to your iPhone’s Apple Wallet. It can be accessed in Wallet at any time.

We strongly encourage members to use Google Wallet as the primary digital wallet solution for Android, but will continue to help you in case you’d like to use an alternative Android wallet option, like Wallet by Wallet Union..

If you have an iPhone, the card will automatically download to Apple Wallet. Check the app for your new card (scroll through any cards that are already there–it may be hiding!). If you have an Android, you’ll need to download Wallet Passes from the Play Store prior to downloading the card.

Memberships cover a set number of people, not households. We have three levels intended for families of all sizes—Dual, Family, and Premium levels. The Premium is ideal for larger households. If more than two adults and four children (or one adult and five children) will be visiting the museum at once, consider purchasing our Premium membership.

Free admission is just the beginning—and your gift to the Carnegie Museums makes a difference! Visit our website to learn more about joining the Donors Circle or Patrons Circle or by calling our Donor Services line at 412.622.5772.

You can also make a donation here.

If you received an email, you must click on the links in the message to receive the discount. We cannot retroactively apply discounts, so please call us before hitting “Submit.”

If you receive a membership promotion from Carnegie Museums, please make sure that the offer has not expired. If the offer is still valid, make sure that you are typing in the web address exactly as found on your offer.

Only one discount can be applied per membership purchase. However, you are more than welcome to select which offer you would like to use.

Your expiration date is printed on your membership cards. We will send renewal notices starting at least two months before your membership expires to give you plenty of time to renew. Please let us know about any address or email changes, so that you receive renewal notices. Update your information by contacting us.

Due to processing time, some materials will cross paths in the mail. This should end once you receive your card(s). If it does not, please contact us.
