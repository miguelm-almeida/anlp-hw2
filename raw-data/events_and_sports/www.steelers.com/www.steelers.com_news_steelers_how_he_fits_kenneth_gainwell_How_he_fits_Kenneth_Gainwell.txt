The Steelers signed former Philadelphia Eagles running back Kenneth Gainwell to a one-year deal in free agency.

A fifth-round draft pick out of Memphis in 2020, Gainwell (5-9, 200) carved out a role as both a running back and kick returner for the Eagles.

In four seasons, he rushed for nearly 1,200 yards and 12 touchdowns in 66 games, four of them starts. He's also caught 102 passes for more than 700 yards and an additional touchdown.

In addition, Gainwell has averaged 22.7 yards on 36 career kick returns, including a 25.3-yard average in 2024 when he served as Philadelphia's primary return man.

A tough, shifty runner, Gainwell has averaged 4.2 yards per carry over the course of his career.

He served as the primary backup to Saquon Barkley in 2024, also being utilized as Philadelphia's third-down back. He's considered a good, but not great, pass protector, but is certainly capable in that regard.

With Najee Harris having left in free agency, the Steelers will utilize Gainwell as a complementary back to Jaylen Warren, who was tendered a contract as a restricted free agent.

He also can serve as Warren's replacement as a kick returner if Warren becomes the team's starting running back.

Gainwell excels at running outside zone, something he did extensively in his days at Memphis, where he rushed for 1,459 yards in 14 games in 2019, his one season as a starter in a program that has produced a number of quality NFL running backs.

He ran a 4.42-second 40-yard dash at his pro day and has the speed to run away from defenders, though his career long is 32 yards.

His addition does not preclude the Steelers from also selecting a running back in the 2025 NFL Draft.
