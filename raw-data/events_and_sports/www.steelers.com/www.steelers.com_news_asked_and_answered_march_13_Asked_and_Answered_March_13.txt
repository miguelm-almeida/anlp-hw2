Let's get to it:

CHRIS HANN SR. FROM SARASOTA, FL: I counted 14 different QBs who started between Terry Bradshaw and Ben Roethlisberger. Names like Mark Malone, David Woodley, Bubby Brister, Neil O'Donnell, Kordell Stewart. It was a dark time in Steelers history. After Roethlisberger retired, there already have been 5 starting quarterbacks with a new one to come this year. Unfortunately, I feel like history is repeating itself and there isn't a plan. With that being said, do you think a veteran is the answer, or is it the draft? The Steelers drafted Bradshaw and Roethlisberger, and the draft seems to be the answer with appropriate development. ANSWER: First of all, I would hardly categorize the 1990s as "a dark time in Steelers history." From 1992-97, the Steelers won 5 AFC Central Division titles, made the playoffs six straight times, played in 3 AFC Championship Games, and in Super Bowl XXX. Now, I don't think there's any argument that the draft is where teams are most likely to find a franchise quarterback, but just because a team wants/needs one doesn't mean there is going to be one available when their turn comes to pick, and just because a team uses a high pick on a quarterback doesn't mean all that then stands between the player and franchise quarterback status is "appropriate development." You included a list of names in your question, and I am going to close my answer with another list: Alex Smith, Vince Young, JaMarcus Russell, Mark Sanchez, Blaine Gabbert, Blake Bortles, Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota, Mitch Trubisky, Josh Rosen, Daniel Jones, Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Bryce Young. They all were quarterbacks picked in the top 10 of the first round since the Steelers drafted Roethlisberger 11th overall in 2004.

TERRY MOSELEY FROM WETUMPKA, AL: The last couple of days on SNR's The Drive with Dale Lolley and Matt Williamson, they mentioned that the Steelers would be receiving compensatory draft picks this year, but when the NFL announced the picks on March 11 the Steelers didn't receive one. Who's wrong? ANSWER: I believe you may have misunderstood what Dale Lolley and Matt Williamson were saying about compensatory draft picks. Compensatory picks are awarded by the NFL based on a formular that considers signings/losses of unrestricted free agents, but the compensatory picks awarded in 2025 are based on those signings/losses in the 2024 offseason. Based on the Steelers signings/losses of unrestricted free agents so far in 2025, there already are projections â guesses â of the kind of compensatory draft picks the team might receive for the 2026 NFL Draft. Matt and Dale likely were giving their listeners a preview of what could be in store for the 2026 NFL Draft.

JOE SCHMAELING FROM PITTSBURGH, PA: We seem to have a QB shortage. Has Charlie Batch kept in shape? ANSWER: Charlie Batch might be in shape for a 50-year-old man, which is what he became last December, but I believe he's way too smart to have any interest in standing in the pocket again and facing a live pass-rush.

MARK KENT FROM SEATTLE, WA: How many of the Steelers Hall of Famers played for either the University of Pittsburgh or Penn State University during their college careers? And who would you select as the top 3? ANSWER: The only Steelers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame who played at either of those colleges were Jack Ham (No. 2 pick in the 1971 NFL Draft) and Franco Harris (No. 1 pick in the 1972 NFL Draft). And since there are just two, both of them make the top 3 by default.

SEAN DELANEY FROM GARDNER, MA: The QBs in this year's draft are iffy at best and the available free agents aren't much better. I know the team would never publicly admit this, but have circumstances forced the Steelers to peek ahead to the supposedly strong QB class for the 2026 NFL Draft? ANSWER: It's way too much of a crapshoot at this point to have any reasonable idea of which college quarterbacks might declare themselves eligible for the 2026 NFL Draft. But I do believe the Steelers are doing their due diligence on the quarterbacks available in this upcoming draft and will have formed an opinion on whether or not each prospect is "iffy at best."

JEFF COLAROSSI FROM STUART, FL: As far as rookie contracts go, is there a pay scale based on when that player is chosen in the draft? Does the position at which the player is drafted a factor as well? ANSWER: There is a "slotting system" in play when teams line up to pay the guys they have drafted. That slotting results in players who were drafted earlier getting paid more, and the difference in money often is reflected in the size of the signing bonus. There are instances when a quarterback, for example, might get a little bit more than a player slotted ahead of him, but that doesn't happen in every instance.

GARY TREIBLE FROM YORK, PA: I'm curious about the existence of any NFL rules regarding "resting" players during the regular season. Because I'm a Monday morning coach, I thought that we should have rested several starters against the Eagles to maximize our chances to defeat the Ravens the next week, because a loss to the NFC Eagles would've hurt the team much less than a loss to the AFC North Ravens. I know that resting starters is common in the final game of the season for teams entering the playoffs, but is it prohibited elsewhere during the regular season? ANSWER: There are no rules against it, if that's what you mean. But "resting players" just isn't done during an NFL regular season for many reasons. Start with the fact that regular season rosters are made up of 53 players, and only 46 get a helmet on a game day. Who gets to rest, and who has to play in what you have pointed out as a meaningless game. How would the players view the decisions regarding who among them is valued enough to be "rested." There are only 17 games during an NFL regular season, and all of the football-related jobs on the 32 teams are precious. How would an owner view a coach who told him he was going to "rest some players" because a loss that week isn't as important as the following week's game? How would that coach's staff react to that? Professional sports is a highly competitive business, and there is a lot of pressure to win. Opportunities to win are not to be taken lightly.

MARK RICE FROM LAS VEGAS, NV: With the addition of D.K. Metcalf, then add George Pickens, Pat Freiermuth, Calvin Austin III, and if Roman Wilson can contribute in his second year, along with possibly drafting one more, the Steelers' WR corps should be pretty strong in 2025. I don't know much about Offensive Coordinator Arthur Smith's schemes, but it seems like what I hear most about him is that he is a very run-heavy coordinator. Does he possess as good passing schemes as he does for the run? ANSWER: With the right mix of talent, I believe most legitimate NFL offensive coordinators can put together an efficient and effective passing game. Take 2020 for example, when Smith was coordinating Coach Mike Vrabel's 11-5 Titans. That season, 32-year-old Ryan Tannehill completed 65.5 percent for 3,819 yards, with 33 touchdowns, 7 interceptions, and a rating of 106.5. RB Derrick Henry led the NFL in attempts with 378 on the way to 2,027 yards (5.4 average) and 17 touchdowns. WR A.B. Brown was targeted 106 times, and he finished with 70 receptions for 1,075 yards (15.4 average) and 11 touchdowns; on the other side, WR Corey Davis was targeted 92 times, and he finished with 65 receptions for 984 yards (15.1 average) and 5 touchdowns. The Titans scored 26 rushing touchdowns and had 33 receiving touchdowns. They scored 30-plus points in 10 of their 16 regular season games, and in 5 of those 10 they scored over 40. Make no mistake, Arthur Smith can coordinate a productive offense. But he, like everyone else with that job title, needs talented players to make it work.

EDITOR'S NOTE: On Monday, March 10, Craig Wolfley, a Steelers favorite who brought toughness as a player, knowledge and entertainment as a broadcaster, and a kindness and decency to all who crossed his path, died at the age of 66. Wolf was a regular reader of Asked and Answered, and he would regularly talk about it during the time of the year when I did a weekly segment on SNR's In the Locker Room. I believe it's fitting to include some of the recent submissions I received in his memory. They are presented here without comment.

DAVID PACY FROM SHERMAN, NY: No question here. Just wanted to offer my condolences on the passing of your friend, Wolf. Loved his insight and delivery. RIP.

CHRISTIAN MÃHRMANN FROM LAMPERTHEIM, GERMANY: What heartbreaking news. I'm devastated. Game day broadcasting and In the Locker Room won't be the same anymore. Maybe God's plan was plain and simple: I have to meet the inventor of the famous "Happy doughnut victory Monday." May he rest in peace.

ROB WOMER FROM PALOS PARK, IL: No question. Just a comment. Loved listening to Craig Wolfley. Knowledge of the game with a great sense of humor. Listening to him was enjoyable and made my day many times. Same for Tunch Ilkin. Another gone too soon. What a loss for Steelers Nation. Condolences to his family.

TOM HENSON FROM MARTINSVILLE, IN: You will undoubtedly get a number of requests to pass along condolences to the family of Craig Wolfley. I would just like to be included in that number.

ROD KEEFER FROM EDMOND, OK: Thank you for the warm and fitting tribute to your former colleague and Steeler for life, Craig Wolfley. He had a tone that fans could relate to, and a knowledge of the game that elevated the understanding and enjoyment of anyone who was listening. Thoughts and prayers to his family. We miss you already, Wolf.

JAMIE MOYER FROM LAREDO, TX: No question. Just sending along my sincere condolences on the recent death of Craig Wolfley. Like Tunch before him, I felt like I knew the man because of his passionate broadcasting talents and his helpful analysis of the game itself both as a sideline reporter and color analyst. In Laredo, there are a fair number of Steelers fans, but unfortunately many of the regular season games are not broadcast on TV here because of the Texans. So I have spent many hours listening to him and Bill Hargrove on my iPhone for games, as well as Tunch, Max, and the entire SNR team. I shall certainly miss Craig and extend my sympathies to his family and the Steelers organization. This hits home for me as he and Tunch were my age. RIP, Mr. Wolfley.

GARY CRAIG FROM LINCOLNSHIRE, ENGLAND: I just wanted to offer my condolences to you and everyone in the Steelers facility on the sad passing of Craig Wolfley. He has been a part of the Steelers as long as I have been a fan. I started following the Steelers the year he was drafted. Most recently I have enjoyed his commentary on the games and his presence on SNR's In the Locker Room. He gave such a human and cheerful presentation and never failed to lift my spirits even after some tough losses. I looked forward to listening to Wolf and Max each Monday after a game. Thank you for writing such a great obituary of him. He will be missed by so many fans.

GLEN WHITTEN FROM AGUADILLA, PUERTO RICO: Having lived out of the area my entire adult life, radio is my connection to the Steelers. For decades when life was hard, as it is for everyone at times, Steelers Nation Radio was my sanctuary. The number of times I've spit out a beverage because of something Mr. Wolfley uttered spontaneously is too high to mention. I miss Mr. Cope. I miss Mr. Ilkin. I'll miss Mr. Wolfley. Rest in peace, gentlemen.

JACK SLUTSKY FROM TZORA, ISRAEL: I just heard the shocking news (to me at least) of Craig Wolfley's passing. He was such a fun and refreshing person to watch or listen to. Please accept my deepest condolences to the family of course. But also to you guys at Steelers.com â¦ to you, to Missi, to Teresa, to Max, to all in front and behind the cameras. Way too young. Thank you for this platform to write my thoughts.

JERRY STUPNICKI FROM GARFIELD HEIGHTS, OH: A comment on the death of Craig Wolfley. I met him numerous times. One time I saw him, I said, 'Hi, Mr. Wolfley.' He said, 'I'm a working man. Call me Craig.' He and Tunch Ilkin were so great together at Steelers Men's Fantasy Camps in Latrobe. We would sit and listen to his stories about football and players. He always had a smile no matter what might have been going on in his life.

OWEN O'CEALLAIGH FROM KILKENNY, IRELAND: I hope that Craig Wolfley now has "nothing but green grass and high tides forever, baby!" Ar dheis DÃ© go raibh a anam dÃ­lis â At the right hand of God may his faithful be.
