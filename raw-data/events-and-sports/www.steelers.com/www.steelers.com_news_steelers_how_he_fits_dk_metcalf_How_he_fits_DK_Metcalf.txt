The Steelers have acquired two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks via trade.

The move gives the Steelers the upgrade at wide receiver the team has been searching for since the 2024 offseason.

Metcalf, who turned 27 in December, is one of the top big-play wide receivers in the NFL. At 6-foot-4, 235 pounds, he is a massive mismatch for most NFL cornerbacks.

Metcalf also ran a 4.33-second 40-yard dash at the NFL Scouting Combine in 2019 while also posting a 40 Â1⁄2-inch vertical leap. His 40 time set a Combine record for the fastest by a player weighing more than 225 pounds.

His explosiveness has translated to the NFL, as Metcalf has had at least 900 receiving yards in all six of his NFL seasons, surpassing 1,000 yards three times.

His best season came in 2020 â with Russell Wilson at quarterback â when he caught 83 passes for 1,303 yards and 10 touchdowns.

In 2024, Metcalf had 66 receptions for 992 yards and five touchdowns in 15 games.

In his career, he has 438 catches for 6,324 yards and 48 touchdowns, playing in 97 of a possible 100 games. He's averaged 14.4 yards per reception in his career, including 15.0 in 2024.

Metcalf has been even better in the postseason, catching 26 passes for 451 yards and five touchdowns in four playoff games, an average of nearly 113 yards per game.

Joining Metcalf with incumbent outside receiver George Pickens, the Steelers will boast one of the biggest and most explosive starting duos in the NFL.

In 2024, Metcalf ran 85 percent of his routes split wide, averaging 13.7 yards per air target, with 26 percent of his targets being 20 or more yards downfield.

Pickens ran 80 percent of his routes split wide in 2024, averaging 13.5 yards per target with 29 percent of his targets coming 20 or more yards downfield.

Metcalf ran a vertical route on 53.6 percent of his routes in 2024, the highest rate in his career. He recorded 503 yards on those routes, third-most in the NFL. On Go routes in particular, he gained 374 yards, second-most in the league behind only Minnesota's Justin Jefferson (387).

Since Metcalf entered the NFL, not wide receiver has gained more yards on Go routes than Metcalf's 1,765 yards.

A second-round pick in 2019 â two picks before the Steelers selected Dontae Johnson â Metcalf ranks fifth in receiving touchdowns, 12th in receiving yards and 16th in receptions in that span.

In a 2019 NFL Draft that also included Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel, Johnson, Marquise Brown and A.J. Brown, Metcalf ranks third in receptions and yards and second in touchdowns.
