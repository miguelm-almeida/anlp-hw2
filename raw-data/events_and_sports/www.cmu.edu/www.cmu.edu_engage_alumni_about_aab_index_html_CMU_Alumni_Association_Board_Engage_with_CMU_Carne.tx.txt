## What does the Alumni Association Board do?

## How is the AAB structured?

## What are AAB members expected to do?

### The following items must be submitted in order for a nomination packet to be considered complete:

Partners. Volunteers. Leaders. Alumni. Friends. The members of the CMU Alumni Association Board are all of these and more.

This hardworking group of alumni reflects the diversity of the university’s alumni body, spanning a broad range of colleges, class years, careers and hometowns as well as interests and experiences. But they all have one thing in common: a dedication and love for CMU.

AAB members use their creativity and professional and volunteer experience to work closely with the Office of Alumni & Constituent Engagement to develop and strengthen programs that connect alumni to CMU and to each other.

For more information about the AAB and how to get involved, contact Jess Tkach in Alumni & Constituent Engagement.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?The CMU community is incredibly passionate and caring. Every time I'm surrounded by my fellow alumni, I'm always struck by how accomplished and enthusiastic they are about the impact they're making on the world. I like to be around people who are making moves — they inspire me constantly.

Why did you join the AAB? I can humbly say that CMU made me the person I am today and I'm incredibly grateful to the staff, faculty, and my fellow students. This is my way of not only giving back to a school I love so much, but also a way for me to stay connected.

Favorite CMU memory:My most cherished memories are when I was together with my amazing community, whether it be studying together in the ChemE cluster, practicing a piece for Dancers' Symposium, putting together the roof of SigEp's booth, or sneaking around campus rooftops (oops!).

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Honestly, the stories from fellow alumni make everything worth it. Each CMU alumni has such an amazing story, whether it's a story of their upbringing, the story of how they got to CMU, their CMU experience, or the story of whatever amazing thing they're inevitably up to.

Favorite CMU memory:Joining Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, being a founding member of COMPASS, SPIRIT fashion show weekends, spending time with my residents when I was a Resident Assistant and hanging out in the CMARC office.

Why did you join the AAB? I joined the AAB because CMU has left such an invaluable mark on my life. I believe in the vision of CMU and feel it is important to support CMU so that this phenomenal experience can be available for future generations.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Getting to meet new people who share my enthusiasm for the school and for creating the best experience for current and future students.

Why did you join the AAB?Carnegie Mellon has always held such a special place in my heart and it's given me so much — and now it is time to give back.

Favorite CMU memory:My final year at CMU, the university hosted the Frontiers Conference, which featured world-class innovators working at the cutting edge of personal, local, national, global, and interplanetary frontiers. I was invited because of my humble work starting an organization at the local frontier in Pittsburgh, and it was incredible getting a chance to hear President Obama speak about how new frontiers in science and technology will help improve lives and shape the future. It remains to be the coolest conference I've ever attended!

Why did you join the AAB?I joined because I have loved being an active alumnus and serving as an organizer of DC's Globally Plaid series, speaking on alumni panels, serving as a Heinz College mentor, and helping with mock interviewing. The student group I founded in 2015, Students Using Data Science for Social Good, (which still exists!) was aimed at bringing together students from all of the colleges that CMU has and uniting them around a common purpose; I look forward to bringing that same sense of community to this role.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?The number of sheer jaw-dropping talented and distinguished alumni that have excelled in their verticals

Why did you join the AAB?To stay engaged and give back to the University gave me life long friendships, mentors, memories and got me my job, giving me the foundation to set me up for life.

Favorite CMU memory:As I walked through campus on graduation day I felt like every step on the sidewalk revealed a flashback to a moment. I felt all my effort, time, friendships and achievements of four years as we walked to the stadium.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I enjoy sharing the lessons that have stuck with me from my time at CMU with students. It's equally empowering and energizing to connect with fellow alumni, sharing our accomplishments and exchanging on ways to elevate the University and each other.

Favorite CMU memory:The night the Steelers won Super Bowl XL. As news editor of The Tartan, I watched the game from the office as we put the newspaper to bed. A few of us left to celebrate, then came back to finish The Tartan in the middle of the night.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I love Carnegie Mellon. I am grateful for the opportunity to be involved at this level, to interface with faculty and staff, and to represent the diverse voices of our alumni. Through the AAB, I feel I’m able to offer a positive impact on the alumni community.

Favorite CMU memory:The friends I made at the schools are still close friends.

Why did you join the AAB?I'm proud of how the schools is growing and evolving and I wish to help shape the next evolution

Favorite CMU memory:I was a member of an amazing team that won the University's first-ever Presidents Athletics Conference Championship in women's basketball and advanced to the NCAA regionals in 1989.

Why did you join the AAB?I am looking forward to sharing my experiences and expertise for the benefit of a university that has done so much for me.

Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory is walking back from an evening Chem lab class across campus and hearing someone practicing the bag pipes - quintessential CMU and a personal favorite since I was also a music minor.

Why did you join the AAB?Interacting with CMU Alumni always makes me feel energized and excited and has helped me in a lot of transitions in my life. I wanted to help give that feeling back to alumni and give back to the school by joining the AAB.

Favorite CMU memory:My favorite memory at CMU was to be a part of two acts in Tepper follies my graduating year. I was part of an international fashion show and also did a ballroom dance group number.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I enjoy most going to campus events and learning about the latest cutting edge research by students and professors. A bonus is actually talking to the students on their research studies.

Favorite CMU memory:I bleed Carnegie Plaid. If you really want my attention, include Scotty Dog. My first month of school, I had tailgate parties that included such dignitaries as university Deans and the famed mascot himself. This memory is one of my favorites and most mentioned by my good friends from CMU.

Why did you join the AAB?My passion for CMU has not waned since leaving Pittsburgh. As an alumnus, I have been active with Carnegie Mellon University and Heinz College and participate in many alumni events and programs - both social and academic. This includes recruiting, student consulting initiatives, and attending alumni events near home. I recently moved from Chicago to Colorado.

What do you like most about staying engaged?One of the benefits of being on a college campus is the diversity of thought. This diversity challenges your belief system and makes you question your purpose as well as contributions to society. I found inspiration in our student body as this engagement only makes me a better person.

Why did you join the AAB?Volunteering has afforded me the opportunity to give back. If we are stronger together, working with individuals who share the same passion for making Carnegie Mellon the best it can be, can only yield a positive outcome. I want to be the representative who encourages other alumni to get engaged.

Favorite CMU memory:PhD Graduation Ceremony. August Wilson, who was awarded a honorary PhD, gave a very inspiring and thought provoking speech.

Why did you join the AAB?Create a stronger alumni network that becomes an advantage and differentiator. Raise the profile of CMU in the US and internationally.

Why did you join the AAB?I am so incredibly grateful for Carnegie Mellon for the terrific education and wonderful on-campus experience afforded me. I am indebted to the university for being so supportive in helping me pursue my post-graduate education and my career. I love coming back to campus and interfacing with the students, faculty and staff. This Board provides yet another opportunity for me to have a positive impact at the University level and in the alumni community.

Favorite CMU memory:During my 10 years as a CMU undergrad, PhD student, and instructor from the 1960’s through the mid 1970’s, I took advantage of the unique environment where everyone on campus could use CMU computers, initially with punch cards and later in computer rooms with teletypes. I was a participant in the formation of a new discipline. I also loved playing clarinet in the Kiltie Marching and Concert bands with the fabulous music majors. We had memorable trips performing at a National Music Educators convention in Buffalo and at Town Hall in New York City.

Why did you join the AAB?Being from SCS and being retired, I hope to bring a unique perspective to the Alumni Board. I want to learn more about CMU’s academic and research initiatives in Pittsburgh and other CMU campuses, and how the Alumni Board interacts with the multi-campus alumni.

Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory is when I outsmarted those who were against SPIRIT's "Black Week," joined the Student Senate Finance Committee, and made "Black Week" an official arm of the Student Senate so it could be funded directly from student activities funds and not bake sales and car washes.

Why did you join the AAB?I joined because I was chosen to be a part of this elite group in which I take great pride. It is an honor and a privilege and a once in a lifetime event for me that means I get to give back in my own unique way!

Favorite CMU Memory:My experience at CMU is a trove of memories: Crew Club, meeting and dating my husband, hard and fun work in the 3D wood shop, and the Beaux Arts Ball. My peers and the staff made each moment special. One poignant memory was sledding by the cafeteria on trays!

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?Tartan pride is alive in my household. The connection we have from studying at, working at, and/or supporting Carnegie Mellon University is genuine and rewarding. It brings me joy to build personal relationships with the CMU community and receive a smile simply from saying, I am a Tartan, too!

Favorite CMU Memory:It is really hard to pick just one! A big highlight was planning the concert for the 100th Carnival; being on Activities Board was an amazing community, and getting to plan and see the events was so energizing.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?I loved my time at CMU. I got so much out of it, and one of the best parts was the people. Joining AAB allows me to be involved in the CMU community, and help alumni connect back to CMU and to each other.

Favorite CMU memory:My favorite CMU memory was the INI holiday party and the spirited karaoke-ing to "Hey Jude" with friends and faculty. Between such moments of levity and all of the hard work, I forged some lifelong friendships at CMU.

Why did you join the AAB?CMU has been a big part of my life and career and I am very proud to be a Tartan. I want to be able to contribute back to the school and help bring the alumni community together.

Favorite CMU memory:Going to the "Apple Orchards", not knowing Apple would grow to its size today but thinking how innovative and convenient it was back then. That convenience made it easy to be efficient with projects and homework, which enabled me to indulge in Buggy ... a sincere passion, GO SPIRIT!!!

Why did you join the AAB?Having been an active alum for many years, my professional experience will hopefully be extremely helpful to both alums and the university. Specifically, giving-back in any fashion has been a passion for decades and having raised two daughters who are both college graduates, along with corporate experience in recruiting and career development, I believe I can help improve the experience for all parties involved.

Favorite CMU memory:Watching my two older sisters apply to, study at, and graduate from CMU was probably one of the most impactful and inspiring CMU memories of mine. They blazed the trail, set the standards and showed me what was possible at, and with, a degree and network from CMU.

What do you like most about staying engaged with CMU?It is so exciting to be around such a motivated, intelligent and hard-working group of people, across disciplines. I love to hear about what different students and alumni are doing as well as learn from them.

Each year, the AAB chooses new members who are eager to contribute to the university and the global CMU alumni community. New members are chosen on a variety of factors, including current board representative needs, level of volunteer experience at both Carnegie Mellon and other organizations, consistency of giving to CMU and ability to contribute to the overall AAB mission.

The AAB has an annual nomination process during which members of the university community may nominate alumni to the board. A nomination form, professional summary and a minimum of one letter of support are submitted for review by the AAB’s Nominating Committee.

Nominations for the Alumni Association Board are currently closed, and will reopen in August 2025.
