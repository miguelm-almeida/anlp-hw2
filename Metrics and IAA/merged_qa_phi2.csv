This is because the question does not specify any other criteria for determining the primary job or the location of the principal office, residence, or place of work. Therefore, it is best to follow the general rule of withholding and paying the local service tax for all jobs held simultaneously. In addition, if there is any doubt or discrepancy about the employment status or tax liability, employers should consult with the appropriate authorities or seek legal advice to ensure compliance with tax laws and regulations.","If an employee has multiple jobs, they should provide their principal employer with an exemption certificate and provide other employers with a pay stub from their principal employer along with a statement that it is from their principal employment."
