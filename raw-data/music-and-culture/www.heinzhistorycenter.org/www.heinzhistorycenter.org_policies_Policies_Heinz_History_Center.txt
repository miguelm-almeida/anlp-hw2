A COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY

Your privacy is very important to us. To better protect your privacy our policies below explain the information we collect, how it is used, how it is safeguarded, and how to contact us if you have any concerns.

SSL technology, an industry standard, is designed to prevent someone other than operators of our Site from capturing and viewing your Personal Information. Since any order information you provide to us on our Site will be transmitted using a secure connection, if your Web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Site.
