We the People of Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh is known as many things: a union town, a tech darling, an “eds and meds” mecca, a haven for pierogi obsessives. But maybe Pittsburgh’s real treasure is, as they say, the friends we make along the way. It’s the people — our neighbors — who embody the true spirit of this place. The ones who want our hometown to be the best it can be, and who do the work to make that happen.

This year’s class inducts movers and shakers from all corners of our community, such as Herman "Soy Sos" Pearl and Staycee Pearl, partners in life and work who are magnifying Black art from their studio in Braddock, and Nik Forsberg of Fet-Fisk, whose pop-up turned brick-and-mortar restaurant is receiving well-deserved national attention. We’re also honoring nurses who are carving a path for other healthcare workers, young activists risking their futures, and many others.

We hope you read about this year’s award winners and feel proud that these are the sort of hardworking, problem-solving people Pittsburgh produces. Cheers to the honorees, who are rightfully the toast of the town.
