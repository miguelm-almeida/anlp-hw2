Many employers have matching gift programs to match charitable contributions made by their employees. Gifts from retirees may also qualify for a match. Participating in your company’s matching gift program is a great way for you to enable your employer to join with you in supporting your philanthropy to Pittsburgh Opera.

If you are a Pittsburgh Opera volunteer, your company may also have a Volunteer Grant Program.

Please contact Torey Gricks for more information about Pittsburgh Opera and increasing your support through leveraging your corporate match, or check out our Frequently Asked Questions section below.

Thank you for increasing the impact of your gift through corporate matching.  Your support helps Pittsburgh Opera continue bringing world-class opera and quality arts education programming to Pittsburgh and beyond.

Employee matching gift programs are corporate giving programs.

For example, if you work for Highmark and donate $100 to Pittsburgh Opera, Highmark’s matching gift program has a minimum gift requirement of $100 and matches your gift at a 1:1 ratio. After you submit your matching gift form, Highmark will effectively double your gift by giving $100 to Pittsburgh Opera, as well.

Retirees may also qualify for a match.

It's a quick and easy way to increase the impact of your gift and leverage your company’s support for Pittsburgh Opera.

Requesting a matching gift is a quick process that you must initiate. You can do this by completing and submitting either a paper form provided by your employer or submitting the information through your company’s electronic submission process.
