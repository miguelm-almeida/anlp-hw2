The destination for all-things-pickled! Picklesburgh is the annual celebration that goes beyond the dill pickle to bring unique eats, food demonstrations, children‚Äôs activities, live music, and more to the heart of Downtown Pittsburgh. The best part? There really is a giant flying pickle.

Held in June, Market Square becomes a showcase for businesses, artists, makers, performers, food purveyors, and more from across the various international and newcomer communities.

Developed in 2013, the Downtown Activation + Public Art initiative is a multi-year effort to enhance the Downtown neighborhood through public art events, creating thoughtful and innovative programming that enlivens unique areas throughout Downtown Pittsburgh.

Live music plays an important role in providing a higher quality of life within urban neighborhoods by supporting cultural expression, social identity, economic development, and most importantly a positive and safe sense of place.
