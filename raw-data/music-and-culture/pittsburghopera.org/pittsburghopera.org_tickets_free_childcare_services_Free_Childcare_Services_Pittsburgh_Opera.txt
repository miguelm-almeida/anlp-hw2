The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room, which will be used exclusively for this service.

There are a limited number of spaces available, and pre-registration is required. To register, you (the parent/guardian of the child) will ‘purchase’ a free childcare ticket when you buy your own ticket to the opera. Your order confirmation email will include a link to a registration form, which includes your seating location, information about any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and you must remain in the building during the performance.

The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance.

Pittsburgh Opera has worked closely with their partners at the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, which owns and operates the Benedum Center, and Priya Amin, the founder of on-site childcare provider Flexable, to bring this program to life.

Where is the childcare provided?

The childcare will take place onsite at the Benedum Center, in its multipurpose room on the second floor, which will be used exclusively for this service.

What are the age limits?

The minimum age to attend these opera performances and sit in the audience is six. However, children as young as two will be able to use the childcare service. Children between the ages of six and twelve have the option of seeing the opera with tickets at 50% off or using the childcare service at no charge.

Do I need to buy a ticket for my child who will be using the childcare service?

Yes, but it's free. Any child using the childcare service must register in advance. Please use the process shown in the "How to add Childcare to your ticket purchase" section below to add Childcare tickets to your shopping cart while you are purchasing your tickets to see the opera performance. You will receive a 'ticket' for the childcare which the usher will scan when you enter the Benedum just like they'll scan your ticket to the performance.

Once I order my childcare ticket, am I done?

Not quite. Your order confirmation email will include a link to an online registration form to fill out. This form will ask for information about things such as your seating location, the child's name and age, any allergies the children have, and other such matters. You will need to fill out and submit that form in advance. The form includes a liability waiver, which you can read in the "Liability Waiver" section of this webpage. The parent/guardian must reconfirm the registration information at drop off, and remain in the building during the performance.

When do I drop off and pick up my child?

The Benedum Center opens 1 hour 15 minutes before the performance starts. You may drop your child off anytime after the Benedum opens up until the beginning of the performance. You are welcome to visit your child during intermission if you wish. Children must be picked up within 10 minutes of the performance’s ending. Children may only be released to the person that signed them in to the childcare area. NO EXCEPTIONS.

After I drop my kid off, can I duck across the street for a bite to eat before the show starts?

No! In fact, double No. The parent/guardian must remain in the building during the performance.

Can I bring toys or books or games, or their favorite stuffed animal, for my child to use?

Yes, provided you adhere to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Bag Policy and their Prohibited Items policy. Pittsburgh Opera will have a range of age-appropriate activities available for your child to use.

Will there be food provided?

Parents may feed their children snacks, e.g. during intermission, but the childcare providers will not provide food to the children. Please note that parents must follow the Pittsburgh Cultural Trusts' outside food and beverage policy.

What about bathrooms and dirty diapers?

Childcare staff will cover diaper changes and/or accompany kids to the bathroom unless the parent requests otherwise. Parents must bring their child's diapers/wipes/pullups.

My child takes medication every afternoon. Will you give my child their regular daily medication?

No, medications will not be administered by childcare staff.
