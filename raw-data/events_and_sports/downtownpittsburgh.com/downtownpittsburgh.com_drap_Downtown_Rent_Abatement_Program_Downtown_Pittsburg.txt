This program is designed to assist new businesses that are actively pursuing a location within Downtown Pittsburgh by offering a rent subsidy. This competitive program accepts applications on a rolling basis, and not all applicants are guaranteed funding. The program provides a subsidy of up to 50% of the monthly rent, capped at a maximum of $2,000 per month for 12 months, with a multi-year lease.

The funds will be paid directly to the property owner or management, in accordance with the lease. The business owner is responsible for paying the portion not covered by the subsidy.
