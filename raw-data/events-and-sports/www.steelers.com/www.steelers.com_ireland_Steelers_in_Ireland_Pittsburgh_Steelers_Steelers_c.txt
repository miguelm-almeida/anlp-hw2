The Rooney family emigrated from the town of Newry in Northern Ireland to the United States in the 19th century, where the family ultimately settled in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Dan Rooney joined forces with Pittsburgh businessman Anthony J.F. O'Reilly to create The Ireland Fund in 1976, which merged with the American Irish Foundation to create the American Ireland Funds, a leading charitable organization benefiting Ireland.

Dan Rooney's love of Ireland also fueled a passion to bring an NFL game to Ireland, a that dream became a reality when the Steelers took on the Chicago Bears in a preseason game in 1997 at Croke Park.

Dan Rooney was asked to serve as United States Ambassador to Ireland by President Barack Obama, a role he cherished from 2009-2012.

While in Ireland serving as Ambassador, Rooney visited all 32 counties on the island, meeting with politicians, media, business leaders and citizens.

The Pittsburgh Steelers were awarded rights to expand their brand and activities for the Republic of Ireland & Northern Ireland, as part of the NFL's 'Global Markets Program', on May 23, 2023.

Historic game to be played in Dublin's iconic Croke Park

Croke Park has hosted thousands of the country's most famous sporting events

Starting in 2025, the NFL has the right to schedule up to 8 regular season international games per season. Up to 4 teams from the conference hosting a ninth regular season home game are now designated to play a neutral-site international game each year. In 2025, AFC teams will have a ninth home game on their schedule.

Teams are selected based on the league's rotational system, which considers conference scheduling and teams that have Global Market Program rights in specific markets.

The NFL has earmarked Dublin as a new international game market for 2025 and strategically selected the Steelers to play in the game as the designated team.

As part of the Global Markets Program the Steelers have been awarded marketing rights on the island of Ireland because of Steelers' ownership family's deep roots there.

Global growth is a major strategic priority for the league and 32 teams.

Playing games outside the United States and expanding the league's global footprint is a key part of that strategy.

The league's international games take American football to new fans and communities around the world.

The Steelers will host 8 regular-season home games and 1 preseason home game at Acrisure Stadium in 2025.

As this is a year in which AFC teams have a ninth regular season home game, the Dublin game will see the Steelers' designated to play the ninth game in Dublin in 2025.

The Steelers and the NFL will host fan activities in Dublin leading up to the game. More information on these details will be released later this year. We encourage you to sign up for Steelers emails and to follow the Steelers social media platforms for information and updates on the events that the Steelers will host in Ireland.

The 'Global Markets Program', which launched in January 2022 as the International Home Marketing Areas (IHMA), grants NFL clubs access to international markets for marketing, fan engagement and commercialization activations as part of an important, long-term strategic effort to enable clubs to build their brands globally while driving NFL fan growth beyond the US.

NFL clubs can apply for rights to selected international markets by submitting proposals for the International Committee to review each Spring. Clubs are awarded rights for at least a five-year term through the program. During this period, a club has the rights to pursue activities in that international market that are consistent with what they can do in their home market.

There are a number of reasons why the Steelers decided to make this initiative across the Island of Ireland a priority. The Rooney family emigrated from Ireland in the 1840s and their Irish roots have remained important to them. Current Steelers President Art Rooney II became the first member of the Rooney Family to visit Northern Ireland since the family emigrated in 1840 when he visited there in the early 1970s. Former Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney and his wife, Patricia, spent a great deal of their time giving back to Ireland and worked hard to help make it a better place, whether that be through establishing The Ireland Funds or his work as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland. He also drove the decision to play an NFL game in Ireland in 1997. Mrs. Patricia Rooney, whose family emigrated from County Mayo in the 1920s, was a guiding force in the establishment of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature.

When the NFL created the opportunity for all teams to become active in international markets, Ireland was on the team's short list. This license will enable the Steelers to bring back some of the traditions and initiatives instituted by Dan Rooney, as well as to bring some new ones forward.

The NFL's 'Global Markets Program' allows the Steelers to be active across the island of Ireland. Over the coming year, the Steelers plan to re-launch an initiative started by Dan Rooney years ago, flag football. Flag is a part of the team's overall international strategy and is easy to play for young people of all ages. The Steelers also plan to enact other events, including watch parties and other football education experiences.

The team is roughly two years into its NFL's 'Global Markets Program' in Mexico, and in that time, has held several in-market draft celebrations, a kicking clinic for both professional football players as well as young people, a pair of youth flag events, a large-scale watch party in Mexico City, as well as a business summit with members of the business community. We'll look to bring similar initiatives to Ireland; and plan to be thoughtful and intentional about how they are introduced.
