The Steelers signed cornerback Brandin Echols to a two-year contract.

Echols was drafted by the New York Jets in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft and has spent the last four seasons in New York.

He has appeared in 57 games, starting 19 of them. He has 113 career tackles, 88 of them solo stops, three tackles for a loss, five interceptions, including two returned for a touchdown, one fumble recovery and 16 passes defensed.

"I bring grit, I am hungry, I am ready to play," said Echols. "I have a chip on my shoulder that I feel like I need to show the world who I really am. I feel like Pittsburgh is the perfect place to do that.

"I have always had that chip. I feel like I have always been underappreciated. Back in my younger days people didn't look at me as one of the top athletes. Wanting to be included in that conversation is what gives me the chip.

"The grit comes from my DNA. It's who I am. It's in me to go out there and be the best that I can be."

In 2024, he appeared in 16 games, starting four of them. He finished the season with 36 tackles, 28 of them solo stops, two interceptions, three passes defensed, a fumble recovery and four special teams tackles. He had a career-high 10 tackles against the Miami Dolphins in Week 14, along with a pass defense.

"Speed, play-making ability, tackling when needed,' said Echols of what he can bring to the defense. "I can bring it all. I am just ready to ball."

Echols played in 14 games in 2023, starting one, while recording nine tackles, six of them solo stops, and a 30-yard interception return for a touchdown against the Miami Dolphins in Week 12.

In 2022 he appeared in 13 games, registering five tackles, two passes defensed and three special teams tackles.

And special teams is something he loves.

"I take pride in special teams," said Echols. "That's what got me here."

His rookie season he started 14 games, missing three while on the Reserve/Injured List. He finished the season with 63 tackles, 50 of them solo stops, two tackles for a loss, two interceptions, including one he returned 20 yards for a touchdown, and nine passes defensed. He was tied for sixth-most passes defensed among rookies, and the only rookie with nine plus passes defensed not selected in the first or second round. Echols was voted the Pepsi Zero Sugar Rookie of the Week against the Miami Dolphins when he returned the interception 20 yards for a touchdown, only the second defensive touchdown by a Jets rookie since 2000.

Echols played college football at Kentucky where he played in 24 games, with 22 straight starts. He finished with 108 tackles, four and a half tackles for a loss, 11 passes broken up, two forced fumbles and an interception.
