The Carnegie Mellon University Alumni Association, in conjunction with the Alumni Association Board, develops meaningful ways to help you connect with the CMU alumni community and current students as well as the university. We're here to listen, share information and resources, and offer a wide array of meaningful volunteer roles to you and all Tartans around the world.
