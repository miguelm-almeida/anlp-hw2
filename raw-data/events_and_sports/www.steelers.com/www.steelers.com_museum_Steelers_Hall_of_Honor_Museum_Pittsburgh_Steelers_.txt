#### Located in Acrisure Stadium, the Steelers Hall of Honor Museum is dedicated to promoting, preserving and celebrating Steelers football. The Hall of Honor Museum is home to over 50 inductees and over 10,000 square feet of Steelers history. The museum provides opportunities for fans to learn more about the franchise, view rare artifacts preserved by the team, and relive the biggest moments and people in Steelers history. A portion of the proceeds go to the Art Rooney Scholarship Fund.

#### The walk through each decade of the franchise is accompanied by interactive videos, music, and calls to learn more about each moment and player. The Broadcast Booth is sure to be a favorite as fans make their stamp on a historic Steelers play call.

#### Collected from 90 years of Steelers football, fans can view each of the six championship rings, artifacts and game worn uniforms from some of the greatest plays in NFL history and more.

#### Perhaps the highlight of the tour is the Hall of Honor that houses the bronzed football of each of the Hall of Honor members, over 50 on display. Visitors also have the opportunity to learn about each member through touch screen kiosks that include bios, photos, and videos on the inductees.

#### The museum will feature a new rotating exhibit highlighting the 50th anniversary of Super Bowl IX, where the team won their first world championship, and the 1974 NFL Draft that produced five future Hall of Famers. This interactive display includes a photo op with an oversized Super Bowl team photo, highlights, quotes, and stats about the '74 team and season, and to highlight the display - the Super Bowl IX Lombardi Trophy for fans' viewing pleasure.

#### Other additions include personalized interactive features for fans and a new 'Hope Harvey' display, paying homage to the team which was the beginnings of the modern-day Steelers. The team was founded by Art Rooney, and he was a players-coach.
