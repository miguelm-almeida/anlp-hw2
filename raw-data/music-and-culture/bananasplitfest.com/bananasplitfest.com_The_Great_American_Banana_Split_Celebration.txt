It started in 1904 with an experiment by a local man, David Strickler. Today it is the official dessert of Pennsylvania and an iconic part of American culture. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013 and, this year we celebrate its 10-year anniversary!

It takes a village, or a neighborhood, to create the magic that happens during this fantastic week.
