## For You

Explore the History Center, the Fort Pitt Museum, or Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village with your scout troop!

At the History Center, scouts can earn badges during special programs while having fun and learning about the history of our region.

At the Fort Pitt Museum, scouts can schedule either a tour of the museum or an adventure program where scouts work on fun activities to help complete badge requirements!

At Meadowcroft, scouts can schedule programs about archaeology, American Indian cultural traditions, and the plants and geology of the Rockshelter. You can also spend the night camping with your troop!
