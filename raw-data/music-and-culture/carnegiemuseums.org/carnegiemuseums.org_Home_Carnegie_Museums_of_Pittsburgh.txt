Gertrude Abercrombie, <em>Where or When (Things Past)</em>, (detail), 1948, Collection of the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art, Wisconsin, Gift of the Gertrude Abercrombie Trust

Jan. 18–June 1

Featuring loans from important institutional and private collections, this exhibition is the most comprehensive museum presentation of the works of Gertrude Abercrombie, a critical figure in the mid-20th-century Chicago art scene from the 1930s until her death in 1977.

Ongoing

Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, the University of Pittsburgh, 1Hood Media, and the August Wilson African American Cultural Center again joined together to host the second iteration of Envisioning a Just Pittsburgh, an inclusive call for art that encouraged artists throughout southwestern Pennsylvania to share their visions for a just and equitable Pittsburgh. We are proud to announce the First and Second Place winners in the competition’s six categories.

Through March 9

Every Egyptian object in the museum’s care has stories to tell, about its creation and original use, its journey to Pittsburgh, and about the lives of those in ancient Egypt. The Stories We Keep invites visitors to see these objects—cared for by the Museum for more than a century—in a new light and to witness the work that will preserve them for future generations.

Ongoing

Sound Series features a broad range of artists and bands from around the world that blur genres of contemporary independent music. The music performances take place in the museum’s intimate theater or silver-walled entrance space. The Sound Series also reaches into the community, utilizing venues such as Oakland’s Carnegie Music Hall and Carnegie Lecture Hall.

Through Aug. 17

Step into an immersive journey designed to break stigma, build understanding, and spark important conversations. The Mental Health: Mind Matters traveling exhibition brings the science of mental health to life at the Science Center through immersive exhibits and personal stories.
