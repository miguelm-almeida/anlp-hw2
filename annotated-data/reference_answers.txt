An employer must "restart" withholding the LST if instructed by the City, if notified by the employee that they are no longer eligible for exemption, or if the employer pays the employee $12,000 or more for the calendar year.
To "restart" withholding, the employer should withhold a "catch-up" lump sum equal to the amount of tax not withheld due to the exemption, plus the same amount per payroll period that is withheld from other employees.

The Office of Management and Budget develops expenditure projections for the five-year forecast by first entering all known future year expenditures into its budget management software, then developing forecasts that consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and initiatives, and finally evaluating requests from City division Directors that align with the Mayor's strategic initiatives.
The total budgeted amount for the City of Pittsburgh's General Fund for 2024 is $684,677,414.
The City Controller, City Treasurer, and Director of OMB are authorized to transfer Twenty-Two Million dollars ($22,000,000) from the general fund to a PAYGO fund for use in the 2024 Capital Budget.
The vacancy allowance in departmental budgets adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions throughout the year.
In the Personnel - Salaries & Wages subclass, Regular salary represents the total base pay for the organization, Longevity pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining agreements based on seniority and tenure, and Premium Pay appropriations compensate for overtime hours.
William "Red" Whittaker developed unmanned vehicles to clean up the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site.
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 is a federal law that allocated $350 billion to eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to respond to the COVID-19 emergency. The City of Pittsburgh received an allocation totaling $335,070,222 from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (CSLFRF).
The four statutory categories for using American Rescue Plan funds are: 1) To respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency or its negative economic impacts; 2) To provide premium pay to eligible workers; 3) For the provision of government services, to the extent of the reduction in revenue due to COVID-19; and 4) To make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure.
American Rescue Plan funds must be obligated by December 31, 2024, and fully spent by December 31, 2026.
